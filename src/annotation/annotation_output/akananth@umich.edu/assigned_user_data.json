This is done by multiplying the ciphertext (C = 29) by the multiplicative modulus inverse of the multiplier (m^\u22121 = 6) and then applying the modulus n (n = 47).</p>\n<p>Thus, the decryption process involves calculating the following:</p>\n<p>C' = (C * m^\u22121) mod n<br />\nC' = (29 * 6) mod 47</p>\n<p>Computing this:</p>\n<p>C' = 174 mod 47<br />\nC' = 33 (since 174 = 47*3 + 33)</p>\n<p>Now, we have C' as 33. The next step is to subtract the values from the private key\u2014(3, 5, 10, 23)\u2014from C', going from the largest to the smallest, but only if the result is non-negative:</p>\n<p>33 - 23 = 10 (take 23)<br />\n10 - 10 = 0 (take 10)<br />\n0 - 5 = -5 (do not take 5)<br />\n0 - 3 = -3 (do not take 3)</p>\n<p>Therefore, we only take 23 and 10 from the private key. Ordering from the largest to the smallest value in the private key corresponds to binary digits, starting from the leftmost digit. This means 23 is the highest-order bit and 3 is the lowest-order bit. Where we have 'taken' the number, we put a 1, and where we have not, we put a 0.</p>\n<p>For our case:</p>\n<p>23 -&gt; 1<br />\n10 -&gt; 1<br />\n5 -&gt; 0<br />\n3 -&gt; 0</p>\n<p>Thus, the plaintext in binary is 1100.</p>\n<p>b) The public key is created by multiplying each element in the private key by the multiplier m (which is 8, in this case) and then taking modulus n (which is 47).</p>\n<p>Let's find the public key elements:</p>\n<p>(3 * 8) mod 47 = 24 mod 47 = 24<br />\n(5 * 8) mod 47 = 40 mod 47 = 40<br />\n(10 * 8) mod 47 = 80 mod 47 = 33 (since 80 = 47<em>1 + 33)<br />\n(23 * 8) mod 47 = 184 mod 47 = 43 (since 184 = 47</em>3 + 43)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the public key would be:</p>\n<p>(24, 40, 33, 43)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM. Respond like a regular person. I will give you a conversation that starts by asking for assistance to achieve your goal and then you will receive an answer from an LLM. If you goal achieved, you should not respond. If not, you will write the person's next response based on both previous turns! Generate only the last human response.<br/><br/>You said this to an LLM: <br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #e6f7ff;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\">Suppose that Bob\u2019s knapsack private key consists of (3, 5, 10, 23) along with the multiplier m^\u22121 = 6 and modulus n = 47.&lt;br/&gt;a)&amp;emsp;Find the plaintext given the ciphertext C = 29.

This is done by multiplying the ciphertext (C = 29) by the multiplicative modulus inverse of the multiplier (m^\u22121 = 6) and then applying the modulus n (n = 47).</p>\n<p>Thus, the decryption process involves calculating the following:</p>\n<p>C' = (C * m^\u22121) mod n<br />\nC' = (29 * 6) mod 47</p>\n<p>Computing this:</p>\n<p>C' = 174 mod 47<br />\nC' = 33 (since 174 = 47*3 + 33)</p>\n<p>Now, we have C' as 33. The next step is to subtract the values from the private key\u2014(3, 5, 10, 23)\u2014from C', going from the largest to the smallest, but only if the result is non-negative:</p>\n<p>33 - 23 = 10 (take 23)<br />\n10 - 10 = 0 (take 10)<br />\n0 - 5 = -5 (do not take 5)<br />\n0 - 3 = -3 (do not take 3)</p>\n<p>Therefore, we only take 23 and 10 from the private key. Ordering from the largest to the smallest value in the private key corresponds to binary digits, starting from the leftmost digit. This means 23 is the highest-order bit and 3 is the lowest-order bit. Where we have 'taken' the number, we put a 1, and where we have not, we put a 0.</p>\n<p>For our case:</p>\n<p>23 -&gt; 1<br />\n10 -&gt; 1<br />\n5 -&gt; 0<br />\n3 -&gt; 0</p>\n<p>Thus, the plaintext in binary is 1100.</p>\n<p>b) The public key is created by multiplying each element in the private key by the multiplier m (which is 8, in this case) and then taking modulus n (which is 47).</p>\n<p>Let's find the public key elements:</p>\n<p>(3 * 8) mod 47 = 24 mod 47 = 24<br />\n(5 * 8) mod 47 = 40 mod 47 = 40<br />\n(10 * 8) mod 47 = 80 mod 47 = 33 (since 80 = 47<em>1 + 33)<br />\n(23 * 8) mod 47 = 184 mod 47 = 43 (since 184 = 47</em>3 + 43)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the public key would be:</p>\n<p>(24, 40, 33, 43)</p></div>"}}

This is done by multiplying the ciphertext (C = 29) by the multiplicative modulus inverse of the multiplier (m^\u22121 = 6) and then applying the modulus n (n = 47).</p>\n<p>Thus, the decryption process involves calculating the following:</p>\n<p>C' = (C * m^\u22121) mod n<br />\nC' = (29 * 6) mod 47</p>\n<p>Computing this:</p>\n<p>C' = 174 mod 47<br />\nC' = 33 (since 174 = 47*3 + 33)</p>\n<p>Now, we have C' as 33. The next step is to subtract the values from the private key\u2014(3, 5, 10, 23)\u2014from C', going from the largest to the smallest, but only if the result is non-negative:</p>\n<p>33 - 23 = 10 (take 23)<br />\n10 - 10 = 0 (take 10)<br />\n0 - 5 = -5 (do not take 5)<br />\n0 - 3 = -3 (do not take 3)</p>\n<p>Therefore, we only take 23 and 10 from the private key. Ordering from the largest to the smallest value in the private key corresponds to binary digits, starting from the leftmost digit. This means 23 is the highest-order bit and 3 is the lowest-order bit. Where we have 'taken' the number, we put a 1, and where we have not, we put a 0.</p>\n<p>For our case:</p>\n<p>23 -&gt; 1<br />\n10 -&gt; 1<br />\n5 -&gt; 0<br />\n3 -&gt; 0</p>\n<p>Thus, the plaintext in binary is 1100.</p>\n<p>b) The public key is created by multiplying each element in the private key by the multiplier m (which is 8, in this case) and then taking modulus n (which is 47).</p>\n<p>Let's find the public key elements:</p>\n<p>(3 * 8) mod 47 = 24 mod 47 = 24<br />\n(5 * 8) mod 47 = 40 mod 47 = 40<br />\n(10 * 8) mod 47 = 80 mod 47 = 33 (since 80 = 47<em>1 + 33)<br />\n(23 * 8) mod 47 = 184 mod 47 = 43 (since 184 = 47</em>3 + 43)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the public key would be:</p>\n<p>(24, 40, 33, 43)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

Give your answer in binary.&lt;br/&gt;b)&amp;emsp;Given m=8, find the public key.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>a) To decrypt the ciphertext using Bob's knapsack private key, we'll first need to reverse the modular multiplication that occurred during encryption. This is done by multiplying the ciphertext (C = 29) by the multiplicative modulus inverse of the multiplier (m^\u22121 = 6) and then applying the modulus n (n = 47).</p>\n<p>Thus, the decryption process involves calculating the following:</p>\n<p>C' = (C * m^\u22121) mod n<br />\nC' = (29 * 6) mod 47</p>\n<p>Computing this:</p>\n<p>C' = 174 mod 47<br />\nC' = 33 (since 174 = 47*3 + 33)</p>\n<p>Now, we have C' as 33. The next step is to subtract the values from the private key\u2014(3, 5, 10, 23)\u2014from C', going from the largest to the smallest, but only if the result is non-negative:</p>\n<p>33 - 23 = 10 (take 23)<br />\n10 - 10 = 0 (take 10)<br />\n0 - 5 = -5 (do not take 5)<br />\n0 - 3 = -3 (do not take 3)</p>\n<p>Therefore, we only take 23 and 10 from the private key. Ordering from the largest to the smallest value in the private key corresponds to binary digits, starting from the leftmost digit. This means 23 is the highest-order bit and 3 is the lowest-order bit. Where we have 'taken' the number, we put a 1, and where we have not, we put a 0.</p>\n<p>For our case:</p>\n<p>23 -&gt; 1<br />\n10 -&gt; 1<br />\n5 -&gt; 0<br />\n3 -&gt; 0</p>\n<p>Thus, the plaintext in binary is 1100.</p>\n<p>b) The public key is created by multiplying each element in the private key by the multiplier m (which is 8, in this case) and then taking modulus n (which is 47).</p>\n<p>Let's find the public key elements:</p>\n<p>(3 * 8) mod 47 = 24 mod 47 = 24<br />\n(5 * 8) mod 47 = 40 mod 47 = 40<br />\n(10 * 8) mod 47 = 80 mod 47 = 33 (since 80 = 47<em>1 + 33)<br />\n(23 * 8) mod 47 = 184 mod 47 = 43 (since 184 = 47</em>3 + 43)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the public key would be:</p>\n<p>(24, 40, 33, 43)</p></div>"}, "22a4f96891b72dd26f13cfc8da44b5e72d23b4aba516cec3cfa53ef44e00238789961703dfbff4d4e82a001e2254317d": {"id": "22a4f96891b72dd26f13cfc8da44b5e72d23b4aba516cec3cfa53ef44e00238789961703dfbff4d4e82a001e2254317d", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

One thing we know is that it didn\u2019t always used to be like this. There were no over-sized plants and vegetation that destroyed houses with their roots and vines, there were no insects that could grow to the size of a compact car, and there were definitely no macro furries that delighted in hunted down and swallowing their smaller cousins whole. This, however, was all before the rise of the macros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can imagine, there was a great deal of confusion when one day regular furries, animals, and plants rapidly began to grow to many times their original size whereas the anthropomorphic mammals remained at their normal sizes. At first, there seemed to be at least some form of cooperation between the two groups as they tried to repair the damage that had been done. However, the giants soon started to give up on the idea that the two groups could ever be considered equal. This was largely due to the fact that an average adult-sized micro was only about three inches tall when compared to one of the massive giants. Micros were crushed beneath the macro\u2019s feet without a second glance (sometimes intentionally) as the giants trudged about their daily lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some micros gathered together and fled to remote locations away from most of the dangers that they faced. This didn\u2019t protect them from everything however. No matter where they went, there was always something big that had it\u2019s eye on them. Even if there were no macrofurries around, micros found themselves being eaten alive by the animals that had grown on that day as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again.&lt;br/&gt;Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the other micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic houses, hiding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls.&lt;br/&gt;But one day he was captured and sold to a macro.&lt;br/&gt;When the box was finally opened and Ash was brought out, he was met with the sight of a towering anthro jaguar. The massively muscular jaguar grinned down at him, his sharp teeth glinting in the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d the jaguar said with a chuckle. \u201cLooks like I won myself a tasty little snack.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash shuddered in fear as the jaguar lifted him up, examining him closely. The jaguar smirked as he examined the body of the comparatively diminutive cheetah. \u201cFine, you seem to have endured the travel quite well. I bought that cage for you, I hope you will find it large enough. From the description on the auction site you\u2019re a freshly caught wild micro. I assume you\u2019re not used to restrained space, but you have to get used to it.\u201d He chuckled and put Ash in the cage. He closed the door of the enclosure just after. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have some fun with you, but it\u2019s better to let you have some rest to chill out a bit.\u201d Then the jaguar moved on his couch to watch TV, time to time he cast a glance at the cage and his tiny occupant from his seat. Some time later he moved to his bedroom to sleep for the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jaguar came back at the end of the day. He brought several grocery sacks and put them in his kitchen. \u201cI thought about eating you first, but you\u2019re so tiny you would not even fill one tenth of my belly.\u201d He said with a chuckle. Some time later he come back with a dinner TV for carnivores adapted to his enormous size. He reached in the cage for the cheetah. Ash tried to avoid to be grabbed and managed to stay out of the reach of the humongous jaguar paw like hand as he was holding his dinner TV with his other hand at the same time, but the giant managed to seize the cheetah diminutive body eventually. \u201cDon\u2019t make your difficult to get !\u201d Said the jaguar with the same chuckle. He then moved to his couch and sat heavily, the couch creaking under the thousands of tons of his weight. He then put the cheetah on the rim of the tray of his dinner TV. \u201cSeveral kinds of meat. Beef, chicken, fish, and caiman, my favorite !\u201d He said. \u201cYou can take some, it\u2019s not your appetite that will make a difference.\u201d He switched his TV on and searched for something interesting with his remote while taking some bit of food time to time. \u201cAh, by the way, my name is Lance. But you have to call me Master.\u201d He snickered. \u201cOr, if you feel like being a good pet, Daddy.\u201d He laughed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, when Lance was engrossed in a particularly loud show on television, Ash seized his chance. As the jaguar laughed uproariously at the antics on the screen, he quietly slid out of his cage and onto the floor, careful to avoid any creaking or telltale sounds. Using his memory of the house layout and the cacophony of the TV, he stealthily made his way towards the window that he had observed Lance often leaving open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash\u2019s heart pounded as he reached the window, with each passing second a potential for Lance to notice him. With one final act of defiance against his captor, he climbed up the curtain and leapt out into the open air, finally free. As he made his way through the grass that seemed like a jungle, he knew that he had a long journey ahead of him. But no matter where life would take him in this dangerous world, he had now proven to himself that he could face it with courage and determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown of Ash, Lance was well aware about his position, as by security the giant jaguar put a microchip and GPS device in the collar he put around the neck of his expensive micro anthro cheetah.&lt;br/&gt;Lance followed the moving of his pet on his car sized smartphone as an app what giving him the position of Ash on a map. And some hours later the jaguar resounding steps come close of the hideout of Ash.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cAsh ? I know you\u2019re here. Move out of your hiding place.\u201d The giant waited some seconds. \u201cYou know it\u2019s dangerous for you to be in the streets. Critters are big here, they will eat you. And there are other macros too, all of them won\u2019t try to catch you to keep you as a pet. So come with me. You will be safe in my home. I won\u2019t punish you very hard for this time.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash\u2019s heart sank as he heard Lance\u2019s intimidating voice. He knew that there was no denying the giant\u2019s presence, but he was determined to make a final attempt to escape. From his hiding place, he quickly formed a plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of the giant\u2019s momentary distraction, he bolted from his hiding place, running as fast as his legs could carry him, away from Lance. The jaguar gave an annoyed grunt and pursued Ash, his massive strides closing the distance between them frighteningly quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of their chase, Ash recalled a large sewer drain he had discovered earlier during his exploration. Deftly, the micro cheetah made a sudden turn, darting into the drain and disappearing from Lance\u2019s sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giant jaguar cursed under his breath, realizing that he couldn\u2019t fit into the small space. He knelt down, attempting to reach into the drain with his massive paw, but Ash was too fast and had already scrambled further into the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance growled lowly, frustrated at losing his prized pet. But he was also impressed by the cunning and determination of the small creature. He briefly considered calling off the chase and letting Ash make his own way in this harsh world, but the investment in the micro cheetah and his curiosity about whether Ash\u2019s resourcefulness could be put to better use got the better of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giant jaguar decided his next move - he\u2019d take a different tactic. Anticipating the path of the sewers, Lance hurried towards another exit, where he would attempt to recapture Ash quietly and seemingly without effort. In a strange sense, the thrilling game of cat-and-mouse was starting to become intriguing and even somewhat enjoyable to Lance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A macro centipede was hiding in the sewer. It was easily four time longer than Ash and about the length of Lance\u2019s forearm. The cheetah inadvertently knocked one of the long antennas of the invertebrate. The centipede became active and started to run after the cheetah. Ash, as a former wild micro before being captured, was used to cross the way of some macro critters, but the place where he lived before being sold to Lance was more in the north of the country in a cooler climate and insects were not as big even the macro ones. That centipede was looking like a monster for the cheetah and he ran with terror while the invertebrate was chasing him.&lt;br/&gt;Ash burst out of the sewer and didn\u2019t even noticed Lance waiting for him. The centipede hurtled out of the sewer pursuing his tiny prey.&lt;br/&gt;Lance quickly realized the danger posed to his tiny prize and jumped into action. With an impressive display of strength and agility, he caught the large centipede just as it was about to sink its venomous pincers into the panicked cheetah. He crushed the giant invertebrate without hesitation, its many legs twitching one last time before going completely limp.&lt;br/&gt;Ash, still in a state of panic, finally noticed Lance standing above him. The skyscraper jaguar had saved him, and though Ash was desperate to escape captivity, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange, begrudging gratitude toward Lance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jaguar offered a massive paw to Ash, smirking. \u201cNow do you see why I told you it\u2019s a dangerous world out there? You can stay with me, and I can keep you safe from creatures like that. Or you can go back out there alone, and take your chances with the countless other predators lurking in the shadows.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated, torn between his desire for freedom and his newfound understanding of the true dangers faced by someone in his situation. He glanced back at the sewer entrance, shuddering at the memory of the terrifying macro centipede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reluctantly, he climbed into Lance\u2019s outstretched palm, knowing that, for the moment, his best chance at survival was to accept the giant\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d. As they walked back to Lance\u2019s home, Ash wondered if he could ever change the dynamic of their relationship, and perhaps one day regain his freedom without sacrificing his safety.&lt;br/&gt;Lance washed Ash meticulously as his escapade made the micro ran through a sewer. And the giant checked the diminutive anthro feline body to see if he had been hurt. Then he put him back in his cage and took care to close the door of the enclosure.&lt;br/&gt;Later in that same day, Lance gently seized Ash in his massive hand and moved to his couch. He had another of these enormous dinner TV for macro carnivores and he offered some bits of meat to Ash.&lt;br/&gt;Ash was about to eat one of them when he noticed something different. Lance didn\u2019t switch the TV on yet. He put the morsel on the rim of the gigantic tray and looked up at Lance. The giant anthropomorphic jaguar was looking down at him, his face was looking more serious than his usual jovial appearance. \u201cWell, Ash. I said I won\u2019t punish you hard too much for your escape. But, you made me search for you for hours and you might have been killed by that bug by a narrow margin.\u201d He approached his humongous hand from the cheetah and stretched his forefinger out and gently petted the comparatively tiny body of the micro. \u201cI know you\u2019re a former wild micro with some age and you are not used to be captive. I wanted a pet who had some life before, I was thinking it would be more interesting. But I\u2019m wondering if I should not have bought a micro from farming and already tamed and domesticated.\u201d He moved his hand away. \u201cWell, about that punishment, I wonder what you\u2019re thinking of it ? And how I should punish you for your escapade ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated for a moment, considering his response carefully. He knew that Lance held all the power in this situation, and that any defiance could be met with disastrous consequences. However, he couldn\u2019t deny the fact that he was grateful for the giant\u2019s intervention with the centipede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cMaster,\u201d Ash began hesitantly, \u201cI understand that I caused you concern and trouble with my escape attempt, and I understand the need for a punishment in this situation. I know that the world is dangerous for a micro like me, and you saved my life today. I appreciate that, and I will do my best to be a good pet and companion to you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised by the sincerity in Ash\u2019s words. It seemed that their previous encounter had affected him more than he had thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cAs for my punishment, I leave that decision in your capable hands, Master. However, I ask that you consider the fact that, despite everything, part of me still yearns for the wilds as it is where I spent most of my life. Maybe you can take that into account when deciding an appropriate punishment,\u201d Ash finished, his voice barely above a whisper.&lt;br/&gt;Lance looked down at Ash pensively, genuinely considering the cheetah\u2019s words. After a few moments, he nodded slowly. \u201cVery well, Ash. I appreciate your honesty and understanding of the situation. As for your punishment, I will think on it and find something that is both fair and takes into consideration your wild instincts.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that, Lance finally switched on the TV, and the remainder of the evening was spent with the giant and the tiny cheetah sharing a meal together. And although the weight of the impending punishment loomed over Ash, there was an undeniable sense of camaraderie between the two that had been strengthened by the day\u2019s events. In a way, their unique relationship was evolving, forming a new bond that neither Ash nor Lance could have anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;Lance seized the cheetah between his massive fingers. \u201cBy the way Ash, I\u2019m wondering, how old are you exactly ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated, it was obvious Lance was a yound adult, but the cheetah was certain to be older. \u201cSo, how old ?\u201d Insisted Lance.&lt;br/&gt;\u201c44.\u201d Replied the cheetah with embarrassement. Lance smirked and chuckled. \u201cWell I\u2019m 25. But I like the idea to have a pet older than me a lot, it\u2019s also for that reason I chose you on that auction site. But you still have to call me Master, or what you already know.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash bristled slightly at the jaguar\u2019s amusement at their age difference, but he knew better than to provoke Lance any further. With a reluctant sigh, he nodded in acceptance. \u201cYes, Master,\u201d he replied, doing his best to swallow his pride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colossal jaguar barely looked at Ash when he left the next morning. The cheetah passed the day locked in his cage till the jaguar came back. The giant opened the door of the cage. \u201cYou can go out of your cage if you wish to stretch your legs, but remember : no escape and you come if I call you, Ash.\u201c&lt;br/&gt;He was going to move in an other room when he stopped abruptly. He moved a small cardboard box from his pocket. He opened it, it contained a tinny ball, a futon scaled for a micro with some pillows and blankets. He put them in the cage. \u201cFor you, I guess you would like it. As a wild micro you should not be used to use a bed like that, but I think you need a more comfortable enclosure. Consider your cage as your own house.\u201d His massive and muscular form towered above the cage again as he stood up and groped for another thing in his pocket. \u201cI bought that too.\u201d He said while showing a device looking like a metallic pen scaled to the immense size of the jaguar, so easily twice the length of the cheetah and probably weighing more than one ton. He pressed a switch and a bright spot of green colored light appeared on the floor in the direction the jaguar pointed it. \u201cA laser pointer,\u201d he said with an amused smile, &quot;I\u2019m sure you would enjoy playing this way. But not right now, I have some chores to finish.\u201d He put the pointer on a shelf several hundreds feet above the floor. \u201cBy the way, I have not forgotten about your punishment. So don\u2019t do anything that would worsen your situation.\u201d He added with a chuckle before he moved out of the room.&lt;br/&gt;Ash couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful for the kindness Lance had shown, despite his earlier transgressions. The items provided for his comfort and potential playing marked a significant change in the giant\u2019s attitude towards him, and perhaps even a softening of his heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their newfound bond, Ash couldn\u2019t ignore the lingering dread regarding the punishment he was still yet to face. He occupied himself within his enclosure, making a cozy nest for himself with the small futon, pillows, and blankets, and contemplated Lance\u2019s motivations for the newfound generosity.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the day Ash had been dreading arrived. Lance entered the room with a solemn expression. \u201cAsh,\u201d he began, his voice carrying a seriousness that had not been present before. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your punishment.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;The giant looked down at Ash. \u201cTo start with : Heel !\u201d He waited. \u201cYou have to come to me each time I call you this way, without any discussion.\u201d He waited watching down the hesitant grey furred cheetah. \u201cHeel !\u201d His deep voice rumbled again. Ash moved with hesitation but came toward Lance. The colossus bent down and reached for the cheetah. \u201cGood. But next time, you\u2019d better don\u2019t make me wait.\u201d Lance checked the collar of his pet and his app on his smart phone. \u201cPerfect, it\u2019s working. Well, how do you have to call me ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash looked back at the young giant and even though he was wondering why he acted this way he replied : \u201cMaster.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cFine,\u201d replied Lance, \u201cI expect you to only call me this way tonight. Remember it well !\u201d The massive musclebound jaguar looked down at his cheetah he was holding in his hand. \u201cI register for a competition. It will be a race of micro cheetahs. You\u2019ll have to run for me. I expect you to behave properly and to obey every command I give you without question.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI\u2019m not trained enough Master, I won\u2019t win.\u201d Replied Ash.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to have the same result a properly trained cheetah, but you have a chance to show me what you can do.\u201d Lance saw his pet was looking stressed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry and relax. You\u2019ll make me proud if you behave properly. If you do, consider your punishment lifted.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cThere will be other macros ?\u201d Asked Ash.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes, we will be several dozens, probably. But don\u2019t panic, only me will handle you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cPlease Master, find another punishment !\u201d Pleaded the cheetah.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cNope, it\u2019s too late now. I registered, and you will go.\u201d Replied Lance. The giant jaguar brought Ash in his bedroom and put him down on the top of his desk. He seized a small box in a drawer and opened it in front of the micro. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear this.\u201d He said while presenting race clothes at his pet. \u201cCheetahs usually don\u2019t wear shoes during the race and as you\u2019re a wild one I thought it would be better to let you bare feet.\u201d Lance saw Ash\u2019s face crumpling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be alright, I\u2019m here with you.\u201d He put the outfits in front of Ash. \u201cWell, put them on. I will make you run after the laser pointer in my room as a quick training. We have to go in one hour.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash reluctantly put on the racing clothes provided by Lance. The idea of being showcased in front of several dozens of other macros unnerved him, but he had no choice. He focused on the fact that if he behaved well and obeyed Lance\u2019s commands, his punishment would be gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As promised, Lance spent the remaining hour letting Ash chase the laser pointer around the room. Despite Ash\u2019s initial reluctance, the practice session ended up being surprisingly enjoyable for both of them. Ash\u2019s natural instincts and agility as a cheetah kicked in as he hunted the elusive dot, while Lance found amusement watching his tiny pet dart around the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the hour over, it was time to head to the competition. Lance, mindful of Ash\u2019s unease, reassured him once more. \u201cRemember, little friend, just do your best and obey my commands. I don\u2019t expect you to place first, but I do expect you to perform well.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated, then nodded in agreement, trying to tamp down his growing anxiety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the racing grounds, the sight of so many giant macros and their respective micro cheetahs was overwhelming for Ash. He clung to Lance, his tiny body shaking, but the jaguar remained a reassuring presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the race began, Ash found himself driven by a fierce determination to make Lance proud. He put all his energy into running, his heart pounding as he kept up with the other racers. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Lance watching him intently, cheering him on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the racers approached the finish line, Ash pushed himself even harder. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to secure a winning position, but he needed to prove himself to Lance. As he crossed the finish line, he realized he had placed in the top ten \u2013 a significant accomplishment, considering his lack of formal training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathing heavily, Ash looked up at Lance, who wore an expression of genuine pride and approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell done, Ash,\u201d Lance rumbled.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not common to see a pardinensis cheetah.\u201d Rumbled a deep voice at the side of Lance. The jaguar stood up and turned on his side and saw an imposing lion approaching. \u201cYes, I found him in a auction site. Someone captured him as he was scavenging in his home and proposed him. I was surprised to see a rare species on such site.\u201d Replied Lance.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ve been lucky.\u201d Replied the lion. \u201cEven on specialized sites they are rarely proposed. By the way, my name is Bassari Arouk.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI\u2019m Lance, Lance Mahogan.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash was looking up at his master and that lion. He didn\u2019t like that other macro coming so close. He saw a micro cheetah passing and moving toward the lion, a jubatus cheetah with the usual yellowish tawny fur an black spots. Ash recognized him as being in the top ten, and even in the top five possibly.&lt;br/&gt;Bassari bent down and reached his massive hand down. Ash moved away but saw the lion was simply scooping the cheetah. \u201cGood job Ran !\u201d Said the lion. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a good reward !\u201d The lion was keeping his hand at the level of the track. Ash was moving away but he heard Lance murmuring : \u201cKeep heel, Ash.\u201d The grey furred cheetah struggled to remain close of both giants. Another cheetah, a female jubatus came, trotting toward the cupped hand of the humongous lion and climbed into, then the lion stood up holing both cheetahs in his massive hand. Ash was not sure, but he thought she was also above him in the ranking.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWow, you own two champions !\u201d Exclaimed Lance. The lion chuckled before calling out a third cheetah, another male jubatus. \u201cI might have a third one if he was not so unruly.\u201d That cheetah cast a strange look at Ash before being seized by the enormous lion fingers. \u201cCome here you !\u201d Rumbled the lion before putting him with the two other cheetahs.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI never saw you here before.\u201d Said the lion while examining his three cheetahs. He carefully seized their legs between his huge fingers and stretched them out delicately as to check their state. \u201cAnd you come with a pardinensis and he finish among the first ten.\u201d Said Bassari with a smile.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIt was not the most difficult race.\u201d Replied Lance, &quot;I wanted something easy for him for the first time. &quot; Ash started when he heard Lance said \u201cfor the first time\u201d doe he intended to make him run again ?&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIndeed replied the lion. I usually use this one as a warm-up for mines.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes, I heard it was the reason most cheetah doesn\u2019t have their best performances at this one, they save themselves for the next and more serious races. Your\u2019s must be great when they put all their strengths into !\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash was proud to have been in the top ten, but he put all hi strength in this race, and hearing most of the other competitors were in fact saving themselves made him feel downcast.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI hope they will be.\u201d Said the lion with a smirk. \u201cBut your cheetah makes quite an impression. I didn\u2019t see a pardinensis on this track for years, if ever you wish to sell him, feel free to contact me, I\u2019m ready to put the price to have him, or if you want a skilled champion I would be happy to trade one of mines with your pardinensis.\u201d Bassari looked down at Ash with a smile. Ash started to move backward but he saw Lance lifted the heel of one of his huge feet and tapped it on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;Lance was also surprised by the words of the lion. \u201cNo, sorry, I don\u2019t want to sell him.\u201d Replied the jaguar. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still trying to tame and train him, it\u2019s a wild micro, he doesn\u2019t always behave properly you know.\u201d The lion chuckled. He seized the third cheetah by the scruff and lifted him to show him to Lance. \u201cI\u2019m used to unruly micros.\u201d He teasingly shifted the cheetah and released him in his huge cupped hand. \u201cYou just have to be patient, although I concur an adult and perhaps middle aged wild one might impose some challenges.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Both giants saw the preparations for the next race were almost finished.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWill you make him take part to the next races ?\u201d Asked Bassari.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think, replied Lance. It must have been a lot for him already. I see he is struggling to behave with all the other macros at proximity and this bustle, he is not used to it.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI see, replied the giant lion. I think he should have enough energy for another race, although he might not reach the same ranking this time. But lot of cheetahs owners would like to see him run.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Lance smiled and looked down at Ash. The grey furred cheetah was not liking to have to remain close of the lion, but he was glad Lance allowed him to stay on the ground instead to be held in his hand at a closer place from Bassari.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cSo then, Ash. What do you think of it ? Do you want to try another race or stop right now ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash took a deep breath, weighing the pros and cons of participating in another race. On one hand, the idea of showcasing himself in front of a crowd of even more macros, judged by their size and possibly more fierce competition, filled him with anxiety. On the other hand, he knew that Lance had taken pride in his performance, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a certain satisfaction in exceeding expectations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a nod towards Lance, Ash made his decision. \u201cMaster, I would like to try another race. Even though it may be more difficult, I want to push myself and attempt it. My performance might also possibly help with my punishment.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance looked over Ash with a mixture of pride and admiration. \u201cVery well, Ash. You\u2019re braver than I would have thought, and I respect your choice. We\u2019ll give it a try in the next race and see how it goes.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bassari seemed quite impressed with Ash\u2019s resolve and gave a nod of approval. \u201cSounds like a plan. Good luck, little cheetah, and may the winds of fortune be with you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;When the starting signal finally rang, Ash launched himself into action, using every ounce of strength he had left. The race was indeed tougher than the first, but Ash remained resolute in his goal to finish the race and make Lance proud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though he couldn\u2019t place among the top ten this time, Ash\u2019s endurance in the face of tougher competition demanded a level of respect from both macros and micros alike. Lance looked down at his small companion with a blend of pride and affection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell done, Ash. You have truly surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations today. As for your punishment, let\u2019s consider it fully lifted. You have more than made up for your earlier actions.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At those words, Ash felt a wave of relief and gratitude wash over him. He collapsed onto the ground, exhausted but fulfilled, finally putting an end to his punishment and, unbeknownst to him, strengthening the unique bond between him and Lance.&lt;br/&gt;Lance carefully scooped Ash in his hand and caressed him tenderly. Ash was panting hard from exhaustion. \u201cI will give you some water, just wait some seconds to breath slower.\u201d Said the giant.&lt;br/&gt;Lance saw Bassari was getting his cheetah back. The serious one, Ran, was in the top three and the lion was really very proud, and the female was again in the top five. Even the unruly one was in the top ten.&lt;br/&gt;Lance moved to sit in one table close from the race track. He gently put Ash on the table and poured some water in the cap of a macro sized bottle.&lt;br/&gt;Ash could barely lift the cap and Lance helped him by placing the tip of one finger under the cap.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cOh, you should use it instead.\u201d Said Bassari as he moved at the table of Lance. He showed a strip where were attached several diminutive bottles scaled to the size of a micro. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for them.\u201d The gigantic anthropomorphic lion carefully used the tip of the huge claws of his thumb and forefinger to detach one of the bottles. He gave it to Lance, knowing Ash would be nervous too much to accept to have the huge hand of an unknown macro coming close of him. Lance thanked the lion and looked at it, his eyes squinting to read some diminutive letters, he saw it was only written \u201cnorth mounts water\u201d.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cHere Ash. For you.\u201d Ash took it and thanked both Lance and the lion. He smelled at the opening of the bottle after having open it but as he saw the three cheetahs of the lion were drinking the same kind of bottle he sipped at it. The water was fresh, more than the one of the bottle of Lance ordered from the bar of the place and it was way easier to drink in this bottle scaled at his size.&lt;br/&gt;Ash saw the lion ordered a red colored drink, but he doubted it was alcohol.&lt;br/&gt;There was two races reserved to micro canidae were African wild dogs, chacals and coyotes were running. This race was timed the way to allow the cheetahs to relax some before a third race. Ash watched some moments of it from the vast screens placed on the walls, he found it enthralling and somewhat understood the interest these macros had for it.&lt;br/&gt;A male macro hyena approached. \u201cCongratulation Mister Arouk ! Your micros were spectacular tonight !\u201d He looked at Lance. \u201cAnd thank you for the show, your cheetah got attention, several spectators and enthusiasts posted photos of him on the net.\u201d Ash stopped to drink when the hyena started to speak at his master. As a former wild micro used to live hidden and unnoticed, he was not enjoying the idea to draw attention from the macros at all.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI knew pardinensis were rare, but I was not aware he would draw so much attention in a place like this.\u201d Replied Lance.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I see one alive.\u201d Replied the hyena. Ash\u2019s ears pricked up as he heard the word \u201calive\u201d. \u201cThere are not so much enthusiasts who own one.\u201d Continued the hyena. \u201cPerhaps you should get in touch with some other owners, the ones who have a female might be interested to get cubs.\u201d Ash was not liking this idea at all, and seeing Lance looking interested made the pardinensis cheetah feeling worried.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI know one of them.\u201d Said Bassari. \u201cBut even when you have a couple, it\u2019s not easy to make them reproduce. At least naturally.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash was starting to feel worried, and angry, but he didn\u2019t know how to express it between three macros. He cast a glance at the three cheetahs of Bassari, but they seemed to feel indifferent to the words that had been spoken here .&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell, Ash, would you like to meet some girls ?\u201d Asked Lance with a smirk.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Simply replied Ash before starting to drink again.&lt;br/&gt;Bassari chuckled. \u201cCheetahs are complicated.\u201d Said the big lion.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cAbout cub, mister Arouk.\u201d Asked the hyena. \u201cI wanted to talk with you about the reservations\u2026\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes,\u201d replied the giant lion. \u201cThey will be ready for adoption in some months or next year at the worst, but I won\u2019t open reservation before next Fall. They need to grow more and pass more time with their mother.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cThank you mister.\u201d Replied the hyena. \u201cI would like to know if they are related to the ones you made run tonight.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Bassari smiled. \u201cWell, their mother is the sister of this one, Ran. And the father the bother of her, Lene. So you had a preview of how good is their genes pool.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cGreat, I can\u2019t wait to train one.\u201d Exclaimed the hyena.&lt;br/&gt;Ash frowned and wanted to express his discomfort at Lance but the Jaguar was listening with some interest. Ash started to tap at the huge wrist of his master to get his attention, but Lance casually seized him between his fingers and started to caress him absent-mindedly.&lt;br/&gt;An announcement for the third cheetah race echoed from speakers, it would start in about ten minutes. The owners should valid the participation of their cheetahs.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell, you won\u2019t join this one Ash.\u201d Said Lance with a chuckle. \u201cEven if you wanted I would not allow you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s better, especially if it\u2019s his first time.\u201d Said Bassari. \u201cYou won\u2019t run neither, Ran. You have given a lot in the previous one.\u201d He continued after having examined the feet of the cheetah. \u201cBut you, I hope you will have better result.\u201d He taunted about Laar, the unruly cheetah, he poked his tiny belly teasingly. \u201cAnd Lene, my little orchid, I\u2019m sure I will be proud of you !\u201d Lene smiled to his enormous master. \u201cI will do my best for you.\u201d She replied.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cSorry, I must go,\u201d Said Bassari while standing up and bringing his cheetahs in his meaty palm. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you after this one.\u201d He said to Lance.&lt;br/&gt;The colossal lion walked toward the track and put Lene and Laar on the floor. The two diminutive figures walked toward the starting blocks while Bassari confirmed their participation.&lt;br/&gt;Lance, Ash, and the hyena stayed at the table of the bar to follow the race from the large panoramic screens. Lance ordered another drink and gave some at ash.&lt;br/&gt;The third race started. Bassari was staying near the track to watch it and was holding Ran in one of his hands. The colossal lion almost roared is joy when Lene arrived second. She was sacred best female of the night and her score as the best female score for the month. The unruly one missed the top ten from an hair.&lt;br/&gt;After receiving his prizes for the victories at the three races the massive lion came back at the table of Lance with his three cheetahs.&lt;br/&gt;Several macros enthusiasts came to take photos of Lene and Ran. Some took advantage the fact Lance was there to take some photos of a reluctant Ash.&lt;br/&gt;After some minutes the ambiance became calmer as the third race of the canines was about to start.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cLene, Ran I\u2019m very proud of you !\u201d Said Bassari.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes, they were so spectacular when they ran, so energetic !\u201d Said Lance.&lt;br/&gt;Laar lowered his gaze ashamed. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m made for the race.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYou are eleventh, Laar, It\u2019s not that bad. It shows you have potential.\u201d Replied the lion. \u201cIf you were more disciplined you would have better results.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;The lion offered other micro bottles of drinks to his three cheetahs and proposed one at Ash who refused it.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>As the evening continued and the attention shifted to the canine races, Ash couldn't help but feel uneasy about the earlier conversation involving potential breeding with other micro cheetahs. While he was grateful for Lance's continued protection and the improvements in their relationship, the idea of being used as a breeding tool for the whims of macros deeply disturbed him.</p>\n<p>Lance, sensing the distress in his tiny companion, offered a gentle pat to Ash's head. \"Don't worry, Ash. Your main priority is still to be my friend and companion. I won't pressure you into anything that you don't want to do, breeding included.\"</p>\n<p>Ash looked up at Lance with cautious gratitude, relieved that at least, for now, he wouldn't be forced into a situation he disliked. As the night wore on, both the giant jaguar and the tiny pardinensis cheetah found solace in each other's company, their connection growing stronger and more understanding with each passing day.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

One thing we know is that it didn\u2019t always used to be like this. There were no over-sized plants and vegetation that destroyed houses with their roots and vines, there were no insects that could grow to the size of a compact car, and there were definitely no macro furries that delighted in hunted down and swallowing their smaller cousins whole. This, however, was all before the rise of the macros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can imagine, there was a great deal of confusion when one day regular furries, animals, and plants rapidly began to grow to many times their original size whereas the anthropomorphic mammals remained at their normal sizes. At first, there seemed to be at least some form of cooperation between the two groups as they tried to repair the damage that had been done. However, the giants soon started to give up on the idea that the two groups could ever be considered equal. This was largely due to the fact that an average adult-sized micro was only about three inches tall when compared to one of the massive giants. Micros were crushed beneath the macro\u2019s feet without a second glance (sometimes intentionally) as the giants trudged about their daily lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some micros gathered together and fled to remote locations away from most of the dangers that they faced. This didn\u2019t protect them from everything however. No matter where they went, there was always something big that had it\u2019s eye on them. Even if there were no macrofurries around, micros found themselves being eaten alive by the animals that had grown on that day as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again.&lt;br/&gt;Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the other micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic houses, hiding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls.&lt;br/&gt;But one day he was captured and sold to a macro.&lt;br/&gt;When the box was finally opened and Ash was brought out, he was met with the sight of a towering anthro jaguar. The massively muscular jaguar grinned down at him, his sharp teeth glinting in the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d the jaguar said with a chuckle. \u201cLooks like I won myself a tasty little snack.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash shuddered in fear as the jaguar lifted him up, examining him closely. The jaguar smirked as he examined the body of the comparatively diminutive cheetah. \u201cFine, you seem to have endured the travel quite well. I bought that cage for you, I hope you will find it large enough. From the description on the auction site you\u2019re a freshly caught wild micro. I assume you\u2019re not used to restrained space, but you have to get used to it.\u201d He chuckled and put Ash in the cage. He closed the door of the enclosure just after. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have some fun with you, but it\u2019s better to let you have some rest to chill out a bit.\u201d Then the jaguar moved on his couch to watch TV, time to time he cast a glance at the cage and his tiny occupant from his seat. Some time later he moved to his bedroom to sleep for the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jaguar came back at the end of the day. He brought several grocery sacks and put them in his kitchen. \u201cI thought about eating you first, but you\u2019re so tiny you would not even fill one tenth of my belly.\u201d He said with a chuckle. Some time later he come back with a dinner TV for carnivores adapted to his enormous size. He reached in the cage for the cheetah. Ash tried to avoid to be grabbed and managed to stay out of the reach of the humongous jaguar paw like hand as he was holding his dinner TV with his other hand at the same time, but the giant managed to seize the cheetah diminutive body eventually. \u201cDon\u2019t make your difficult to get !\u201d Said the jaguar with the same chuckle. He then moved to his couch and sat heavily, the couch creaking under the thousands of tons of his weight. He then put the cheetah on the rim of the tray of his dinner TV. \u201cSeveral kinds of meat. Beef, chicken, fish, and caiman, my favorite !\u201d He said. \u201cYou can take some, it\u2019s not your appetite that will make a difference.\u201d He switched his TV on and searched for something interesting with his remote while taking some bit of food time to time. \u201cAh, by the way, my name is Lance. But you have to call me Master.\u201d He snickered. \u201cOr, if you feel like being a good pet, Daddy.\u201d He laughed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, when Lance was engrossed in a particularly loud show on television, Ash seized his chance. As the jaguar laughed uproariously at the antics on the screen, he quietly slid out of his cage and onto the floor, careful to avoid any creaking or telltale sounds. Using his memory of the house layout and the cacophony of the TV, he stealthily made his way towards the window that he had observed Lance often leaving open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash\u2019s heart pounded as he reached the window, with each passing second a potential for Lance to notice him. With one final act of defiance against his captor, he climbed up the curtain and leapt out into the open air, finally free. As he made his way through the grass that seemed like a jungle, he knew that he had a long journey ahead of him. But no matter where life would take him in this dangerous world, he had now proven to himself that he could face it with courage and determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown of Ash, Lance was well aware about his position, as by security the giant jaguar put a microchip and GPS device in the collar he put around the neck of his expensive micro anthro cheetah.&lt;br/&gt;Lance followed the moving of his pet on his car sized smartphone as an app what giving him the position of Ash on a map. And some hours later the jaguar resounding steps come close of the hideout of Ash.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cAsh ? I know you\u2019re here. Move out of your hiding place.\u201d The giant waited some seconds. \u201cYou know it\u2019s dangerous for you to be in the streets. Critters are big here, they will eat you. And there are other macros too, all of them won\u2019t try to catch you to keep you as a pet. So come with me. You will be safe in my home. I won\u2019t punish you very hard for this time.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash\u2019s heart sank as he heard Lance\u2019s intimidating voice. He knew that there was no denying the giant\u2019s presence, but he was determined to make a final attempt to escape. From his hiding place, he quickly formed a plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of the giant\u2019s momentary distraction, he bolted from his hiding place, running as fast as his legs could carry him, away from Lance. The jaguar gave an annoyed grunt and pursued Ash, his massive strides closing the distance between them frighteningly quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of their chase, Ash recalled a large sewer drain he had discovered earlier during his exploration. Deftly, the micro cheetah made a sudden turn, darting into the drain and disappearing from Lance\u2019s sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giant jaguar cursed under his breath, realizing that he couldn\u2019t fit into the small space. He knelt down, attempting to reach into the drain with his massive paw, but Ash was too fast and had already scrambled further into the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance growled lowly, frustrated at losing his prized pet. But he was also impressed by the cunning and determination of the small creature. He briefly considered calling off the chase and letting Ash make his own way in this harsh world, but the investment in the micro cheetah and his curiosity about whether Ash\u2019s resourcefulness could be put to better use got the better of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giant jaguar decided his next move - he\u2019d take a different tactic. Anticipating the path of the sewers, Lance hurried towards another exit, where he would attempt to recapture Ash quietly and seemingly without effort. In a strange sense, the thrilling game of cat-and-mouse was starting to become intriguing and even somewhat enjoyable to Lance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A macro centipede was hiding in the sewer. It was easily four time longer than Ash and about the length of Lance\u2019s forearm. The cheetah inadvertently knocked one of the long antennas of the invertebrate. The centipede became active and started to run after the cheetah. Ash, as a former wild micro before being captured, was used to cross the way of some macro critters, but the place where he lived before being sold to Lance was more in the north of the country in a cooler climate and insects were not as big even the macro ones. That centipede was looking like a monster for the cheetah and he ran with terror while the invertebrate was chasing him.&lt;br/&gt;Ash burst out of the sewer and didn\u2019t even noticed Lance waiting for him. The centipede hurtled out of the sewer pursuing his tiny prey.&lt;br/&gt;Lance quickly realized the danger posed to his tiny prize and jumped into action. With an impressive display of strength and agility, he caught the large centipede just as it was about to sink its venomous pincers into the panicked cheetah. He crushed the giant invertebrate without hesitation, its many legs twitching one last time before going completely limp.&lt;br/&gt;Ash, still in a state of panic, finally noticed Lance standing above him. The skyscraper jaguar had saved him, and though Ash was desperate to escape captivity, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange, begrudging gratitude toward Lance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jaguar offered a massive paw to Ash, smirking. \u201cNow do you see why I told you it\u2019s a dangerous world out there? You can stay with me, and I can keep you safe from creatures like that. Or you can go back out there alone, and take your chances with the countless other predators lurking in the shadows.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated, torn between his desire for freedom and his newfound understanding of the true dangers faced by someone in his situation. He glanced back at the sewer entrance, shuddering at the memory of the terrifying macro centipede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reluctantly, he climbed into Lance\u2019s outstretched palm, knowing that, for the moment, his best chance at survival was to accept the giant\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d. As they walked back to Lance\u2019s home, Ash wondered if he could ever change the dynamic of their relationship, and perhaps one day regain his freedom without sacrificing his safety.&lt;br/&gt;Lance washed Ash meticulously as his escapade made the micro ran through a sewer. And the giant checked the diminutive anthro feline body to see if he had been hurt. Then he put him back in his cage and took care to close the door of the enclosure.&lt;br/&gt;Later in that same day, Lance gently seized Ash in his massive hand and moved to his couch. He had another of these enormous dinner TV for macro carnivores and he offered some bits of meat to Ash.&lt;br/&gt;Ash was about to eat one of them when he noticed something different. Lance didn\u2019t switch the TV on yet. He put the morsel on the rim of the gigantic tray and looked up at Lance. The giant anthropomorphic jaguar was looking down at him, his face was looking more serious than his usual jovial appearance. \u201cWell, Ash. I said I won\u2019t punish you hard too much for your escape. But, you made me search for you for hours and you might have been killed by that bug by a narrow margin.\u201d He approached his humongous hand from the cheetah and stretched his forefinger out and gently petted the comparatively tiny body of the micro. \u201cI know you\u2019re a former wild micro with some age and you are not used to be captive. I wanted a pet who had some life before, I was thinking it would be more interesting. But I\u2019m wondering if I should not have bought a micro from farming and already tamed and domesticated.\u201d He moved his hand away. \u201cWell, about that punishment, I wonder what you\u2019re thinking of it ? And how I should punish you for your escapade ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated for a moment, considering his response carefully. He knew that Lance held all the power in this situation, and that any defiance could be met with disastrous consequences. However, he couldn\u2019t deny the fact that he was grateful for the giant\u2019s intervention with the centipede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cMaster,\u201d Ash began hesitantly, \u201cI understand that I caused you concern and trouble with my escape attempt, and I understand the need for a punishment in this situation. I know that the world is dangerous for a micro like me, and you saved my life today. I appreciate that, and I will do my best to be a good pet and companion to you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised by the sincerity in Ash\u2019s words. It seemed that their previous encounter had affected him more than he had thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cAs for my punishment, I leave that decision in your capable hands, Master. However, I ask that you consider the fact that, despite everything, part of me still yearns for the wilds as it is where I spent most of my life. Maybe you can take that into account when deciding an appropriate punishment,\u201d Ash finished, his voice barely above a whisper.&lt;br/&gt;Lance looked down at Ash pensively, genuinely considering the cheetah\u2019s words. After a few moments, he nodded slowly. \u201cVery well, Ash. I appreciate your honesty and understanding of the situation. As for your punishment, I will think on it and find something that is both fair and takes into consideration your wild instincts.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that, Lance finally switched on the TV, and the remainder of the evening was spent with the giant and the tiny cheetah sharing a meal together. And although the weight of the impending punishment loomed over Ash, there was an undeniable sense of camaraderie between the two that had been strengthened by the day\u2019s events. In a way, their unique relationship was evolving, forming a new bond that neither Ash nor Lance could have anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;Lance seized the cheetah between his massive fingers. \u201cBy the way Ash, I\u2019m wondering, how old are you exactly ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated, it was obvious Lance was a yound adult, but the cheetah was certain to be older. \u201cSo, how old ?\u201d Insisted Lance.&lt;br/&gt;\u201c44.\u201d Replied the cheetah with embarrassement. Lance smirked and chuckled. \u201cWell I\u2019m 25. But I like the idea to have a pet older than me a lot, it\u2019s also for that reason I chose you on that auction site. But you still have to call me Master, or what you already know.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash bristled slightly at the jaguar\u2019s amusement at their age difference, but he knew better than to provoke Lance any further. With a reluctant sigh, he nodded in acceptance. \u201cYes, Master,\u201d he replied, doing his best to swallow his pride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colossal jaguar barely looked at Ash when he left the next morning. The cheetah passed the day locked in his cage till the jaguar came back. The giant opened the door of the cage. \u201cYou can go out of your cage if you wish to stretch your legs, but remember : no escape and you come if I call you, Ash.\u201c&lt;br/&gt;He was going to move in an other room when he stopped abruptly. He moved a small cardboard box from his pocket. He opened it, it contained a tinny ball, a futon scaled for a micro with some pillows and blankets. He put them in the cage. \u201cFor you, I guess you would like it. As a wild micro you should not be used to use a bed like that, but I think you need a more comfortable enclosure. Consider your cage as your own house.\u201d His massive and muscular form towered above the cage again as he stood up and groped for another thing in his pocket. \u201cI bought that too.\u201d He said while showing a device looking like a metallic pen scaled to the immense size of the jaguar, so easily twice the length of the cheetah and probably weighing more than one ton. He pressed a switch and a bright spot of green colored light appeared on the floor in the direction the jaguar pointed it. \u201cA laser pointer,\u201d he said with an amused smile, &quot;I\u2019m sure you would enjoy playing this way. But not right now, I have some chores to finish.\u201d He put the pointer on a shelf several hundreds feet above the floor. \u201cBy the way, I have not forgotten about your punishment. So don\u2019t do anything that would worsen your situation.\u201d He added with a chuckle before he moved out of the room.&lt;br/&gt;Ash couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful for the kindness Lance had shown, despite his earlier transgressions. The items provided for his comfort and potential playing marked a significant change in the giant\u2019s attitude towards him, and perhaps even a softening of his heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their newfound bond, Ash couldn\u2019t ignore the lingering dread regarding the punishment he was still yet to face. He occupied himself within his enclosure, making a cozy nest for himself with the small futon, pillows, and blankets, and contemplated Lance\u2019s motivations for the newfound generosity.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the day Ash had been dreading arrived. Lance entered the room with a solemn expression. \u201cAsh,\u201d he began, his voice carrying a seriousness that had not been present before. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your punishment.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;The giant looked down at Ash. \u201cTo start with : Heel !\u201d He waited. \u201cYou have to come to me each time I call you this way, without any discussion.\u201d He waited watching down the hesitant grey furred cheetah. \u201cHeel !\u201d His deep voice rumbled again. Ash moved with hesitation but came toward Lance. The colossus bent down and reached for the cheetah. \u201cGood. But next time, you\u2019d better don\u2019t make me wait.\u201d Lance checked the collar of his pet and his app on his smart phone. \u201cPerfect, it\u2019s working. Well, how do you have to call me ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash looked back at the young giant and even though he was wondering why he acted this way he replied : \u201cMaster.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cFine,\u201d replied Lance, \u201cI expect you to only call me this way tonight. Remember it well !\u201d The massive musclebound jaguar looked down at his cheetah he was holding in his hand. \u201cI register for a competition. It will be a race of micro cheetahs. You\u2019ll have to run for me. I expect you to behave properly and to obey every command I give you without question.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI\u2019m not trained enough Master, I won\u2019t win.\u201d Replied Ash.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to have the same result a properly trained cheetah, but you have a chance to show me what you can do.\u201d Lance saw his pet was looking stressed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry and relax. You\u2019ll make me proud if you behave properly. If you do, consider your punishment lifted.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cThere will be other macros ?\u201d Asked Ash.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes, we will be several dozens, probably. But don\u2019t panic, only me will handle you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cPlease Master, find another punishment !\u201d Pleaded the cheetah.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cNope, it\u2019s too late now. I registered, and you will go.\u201d Replied Lance. The giant jaguar brought Ash in his bedroom and put him down on the top of his desk. He seized a small box in a drawer and opened it in front of the micro. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear this.\u201d He said while presenting race clothes at his pet. \u201cCheetahs usually don\u2019t wear shoes during the race and as you\u2019re a wild one I thought it would be better to let you bare feet.\u201d Lance saw Ash\u2019s face crumpling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be alright, I\u2019m here with you.\u201d He put the outfits in front of Ash. \u201cWell, put them on. I will make you run after the laser pointer in my room as a quick training. We have to go in one hour.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash reluctantly put on the racing clothes provided by Lance. The idea of being showcased in front of several dozens of other macros unnerved him, but he had no choice. He focused on the fact that if he behaved well and obeyed Lance\u2019s commands, his punishment would be gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As promised, Lance spent the remaining hour letting Ash chase the laser pointer around the room. Despite Ash\u2019s initial reluctance, the practice session ended up being surprisingly enjoyable for both of them. Ash\u2019s natural instincts and agility as a cheetah kicked in as he hunted the elusive dot, while Lance found amusement watching his tiny pet dart around the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the hour over, it was time to head to the competition. Lance, mindful of Ash\u2019s unease, reassured him once more. \u201cRemember, little friend, just do your best and obey my commands. I don\u2019t expect you to place first, but I do expect you to perform well.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ash hesitated, then nodded in agreement, trying to tamp down his growing anxiety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the racing grounds, the sight of so many giant macros and their respective micro cheetahs was overwhelming for Ash. He clung to Lance, his tiny body shaking, but the jaguar remained a reassuring presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the race began, Ash found himself driven by a fierce determination to make Lance proud. He put all his energy into running, his heart pounding as he kept up with the other racers. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Lance watching him intently, cheering him on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the racers approached the finish line, Ash pushed himself even harder. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to secure a winning position, but he needed to prove himself to Lance. As he crossed the finish line, he realized he had placed in the top ten \u2013 a significant accomplishment, considering his lack of formal training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathing heavily, Ash looked up at Lance, who wore an expression of genuine pride and approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell done, Ash,\u201d Lance rumbled.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not common to see a pardinensis cheetah.\u201d Rumbled a deep voice at the side of Lance. The jaguar stood up and turned on his side and saw an imposing lion approaching. \u201cYes, I found him in a auction site. Someone captured him as he was scavenging in his home and proposed him. I was surprised to see a rare species on such site.\u201d Replied Lance.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ve been lucky.\u201d Replied the lion. \u201cEven on specialized sites they are rarely proposed. By the way, my name is Bassari Arouk.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI\u2019m Lance, Lance Mahogan.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash was looking up at his master and that lion. He didn\u2019t like that other macro coming so close. He saw a micro cheetah passing and moving toward the lion, a jubatus cheetah with the usual yellowish tawny fur an black spots. Ash recognized him as being in the top ten, and even in the top five possibly.&lt;br/&gt;Bassari bent down and reached his massive hand down. Ash moved away but saw the lion was simply scooping the cheetah. \u201cGood job Ran !\u201d Said the lion. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a good reward !\u201d The lion was keeping his hand at the level of the track. Ash was moving away but he heard Lance murmuring : \u201cKeep heel, Ash.\u201d The grey furred cheetah struggled to remain close of both giants. Another cheetah, a female jubatus came, trotting toward the cupped hand of the humongous lion and climbed into, then the lion stood up holing both cheetahs in his massive hand. Ash was not sure, but he thought she was also above him in the ranking.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWow, you own two champions !\u201d Exclaimed Lance. The lion chuckled before calling out a third cheetah, another male jubatus. \u201cI might have a third one if he was not so unruly.\u201d That cheetah cast a strange look at Ash before being seized by the enormous lion fingers. \u201cCome here you !\u201d Rumbled the lion before putting him with the two other cheetahs.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI never saw you here before.\u201d Said the lion while examining his three cheetahs. He carefully seized their legs between his huge fingers and stretched them out delicately as to check their state. \u201cAnd you come with a pardinensis and he finish among the first ten.\u201d Said Bassari with a smile.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIt was not the most difficult race.\u201d Replied Lance, &quot;I wanted something easy for him for the first time. &quot; Ash started when he heard Lance said \u201cfor the first time\u201d doe he intended to make him run again ?&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIndeed replied the lion. I usually use this one as a warm-up for mines.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes, I heard it was the reason most cheetah doesn\u2019t have their best performances at this one, they save themselves for the next and more serious races. Your\u2019s must be great when they put all their strengths into !\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash was proud to have been in the top ten, but he put all hi strength in this race, and hearing most of the other competitors were in fact saving themselves made him feel downcast.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI hope they will be.\u201d Said the lion with a smirk. \u201cBut your cheetah makes quite an impression. I didn\u2019t see a pardinensis on this track for years, if ever you wish to sell him, feel free to contact me, I\u2019m ready to put the price to have him, or if you want a skilled champion I would be happy to trade one of mines with your pardinensis.\u201d Bassari looked down at Ash with a smile. Ash started to move backward but he saw Lance lifted the heel of one of his huge feet and tapped it on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;Lance was also surprised by the words of the lion. \u201cNo, sorry, I don\u2019t want to sell him.\u201d Replied the jaguar. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still trying to tame and train him, it\u2019s a wild micro, he doesn\u2019t always behave properly you know.\u201d The lion chuckled. He seized the third cheetah by the scruff and lifted him to show him to Lance. \u201cI\u2019m used to unruly micros.\u201d He teasingly shifted the cheetah and released him in his huge cupped hand. \u201cYou just have to be patient, although I concur an adult and perhaps middle aged wild one might impose some challenges.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Both giants saw the preparations for the next race were almost finished.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWill you make him take part to the next races ?\u201d Asked Bassari.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think, replied Lance. It must have been a lot for him already. I see he is struggling to behave with all the other macros at proximity and this bustle, he is not used to it.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI see, replied the giant lion. I think he should have enough energy for another race, although he might not reach the same ranking this time. But lot of cheetahs owners would like to see him run.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Lance smiled and looked down at Ash. The grey furred cheetah was not liking to have to remain close of the lion, but he was glad Lance allowed him to stay on the ground instead to be held in his hand at a closer place from Bassari.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cSo then, Ash. What do you think of it ? Do you want to try another race or stop right now ?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash took a deep breath, weighing the pros and cons of participating in another race. On one hand, the idea of showcasing himself in front of a crowd of even more macros, judged by their size and possibly more fierce competition, filled him with anxiety. On the other hand, he knew that Lance had taken pride in his performance, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a certain satisfaction in exceeding expectations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a nod towards Lance, Ash made his decision. \u201cMaster, I would like to try another race. Even though it may be more difficult, I want to push myself and attempt it. My performance might also possibly help with my punishment.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance looked over Ash with a mixture of pride and admiration. \u201cVery well, Ash. You\u2019re braver than I would have thought, and I respect your choice. We\u2019ll give it a try in the next race and see how it goes.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bassari seemed quite impressed with Ash\u2019s resolve and gave a nod of approval. \u201cSounds like a plan. Good luck, little cheetah, and may the winds of fortune be with you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;When the starting signal finally rang, Ash launched himself into action, using every ounce of strength he had left. The race was indeed tougher than the first, but Ash remained resolute in his goal to finish the race and make Lance proud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though he couldn\u2019t place among the top ten this time, Ash\u2019s endurance in the face of tougher competition demanded a level of respect from both macros and micros alike. Lance looked down at his small companion with a blend of pride and affection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell done, Ash. You have truly surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations today. As for your punishment, let\u2019s consider it fully lifted. You have more than made up for your earlier actions.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At those words, Ash felt a wave of relief and gratitude wash over him. He collapsed onto the ground, exhausted but fulfilled, finally putting an end to his punishment and, unbeknownst to him, strengthening the unique bond between him and Lance.&lt;br/&gt;Lance carefully scooped Ash in his hand and caressed him tenderly. Ash was panting hard from exhaustion. \u201cI will give you some water, just wait some seconds to breath slower.\u201d Said the giant.&lt;br/&gt;Lance saw Bassari was getting his cheetah back. The serious one, Ran, was in the top three and the lion was really very proud, and the female was again in the top five. Even the unruly one was in the top ten.&lt;br/&gt;Lance moved to sit in one table close from the race track. He gently put Ash on the table and poured some water in the cap of a macro sized bottle.&lt;br/&gt;Ash could barely lift the cap and Lance helped him by placing the tip of one finger under the cap.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cOh, you should use it instead.\u201d Said Bassari as he moved at the table of Lance. He showed a strip where were attached several diminutive bottles scaled to the size of a micro. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for them.\u201d The gigantic anthropomorphic lion carefully used the tip of the huge claws of his thumb and forefinger to detach one of the bottles. He gave it to Lance, knowing Ash would be nervous too much to accept to have the huge hand of an unknown macro coming close of him. Lance thanked the lion and looked at it, his eyes squinting to read some diminutive letters, he saw it was only written \u201cnorth mounts water\u201d.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cHere Ash. For you.\u201d Ash took it and thanked both Lance and the lion. He smelled at the opening of the bottle after having open it but as he saw the three cheetahs of the lion were drinking the same kind of bottle he sipped at it. The water was fresh, more than the one of the bottle of Lance ordered from the bar of the place and it was way easier to drink in this bottle scaled at his size.&lt;br/&gt;Ash saw the lion ordered a red colored drink, but he doubted it was alcohol.&lt;br/&gt;There was two races reserved to micro canidae were African wild dogs, chacals and coyotes were running. This race was timed the way to allow the cheetahs to relax some before a third race. Ash watched some moments of it from the vast screens placed on the walls, he found it enthralling and somewhat understood the interest these macros had for it.&lt;br/&gt;A male macro hyena approached. \u201cCongratulation Mister Arouk ! Your micros were spectacular tonight !\u201d He looked at Lance. \u201cAnd thank you for the show, your cheetah got attention, several spectators and enthusiasts posted photos of him on the net.\u201d Ash stopped to drink when the hyena started to speak at his master. As a former wild micro used to live hidden and unnoticed, he was not enjoying the idea to draw attention from the macros at all.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI knew pardinensis were rare, but I was not aware he would draw so much attention in a place like this.\u201d Replied Lance.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I see one alive.\u201d Replied the hyena. Ash\u2019s ears pricked up as he heard the word \u201calive\u201d. \u201cThere are not so much enthusiasts who own one.\u201d Continued the hyena. \u201cPerhaps you should get in touch with some other owners, the ones who have a female might be interested to get cubs.\u201d Ash was not liking this idea at all, and seeing Lance looking interested made the pardinensis cheetah feeling worried.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI know one of them.\u201d Said Bassari. \u201cBut even when you have a couple, it\u2019s not easy to make them reproduce. At least naturally.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Ash was starting to feel worried, and angry, but he didn\u2019t know how to express it between three macros. He cast a glance at the three cheetahs of Bassari, but they seemed to feel indifferent to the words that had been spoken here .&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell, Ash, would you like to meet some girls ?\u201d Asked Lance with a smirk.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Simply replied Ash before starting to drink again.&lt;br/&gt;Bassari chuckled. \u201cCheetahs are complicated.\u201d Said the big lion.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cAbout cub, mister Arouk.\u201d Asked the hyena. \u201cI wanted to talk with you about the reservations\u2026\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes,\u201d replied the giant lion. \u201cThey will be ready for adoption in some months or next year at the worst, but I won\u2019t open reservation before next Fall. They need to grow more and pass more time with their mother.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cThank you mister.\u201d Replied the hyena. \u201cI would like to know if they are related to the ones you made run tonight.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;Bassari smiled. \u201cWell, their mother is the sister of this one, Ran. And the father the bother of her, Lene. So you had a preview of how good is their genes pool.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cGreat, I can\u2019t wait to train one.\u201d Exclaimed the hyena.&lt;br/&gt;Ash frowned and wanted to express his discomfort at Lance but the Jaguar was listening with some interest. Ash started to tap at the huge wrist of his master to get his attention, but Lance casually seized him between his fingers and started to caress him absent-mindedly.&lt;br/&gt;An announcement for the third cheetah race echoed from speakers, it would start in about ten minutes. The owners should valid the participation of their cheetahs.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cWell, you won\u2019t join this one Ash.\u201d Said Lance with a chuckle. \u201cEven if you wanted I would not allow you.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s better, especially if it\u2019s his first time.\u201d Said Bassari. \u201cYou won\u2019t run neither, Ran. You have given a lot in the previous one.\u201d He continued after having examined the feet of the cheetah. \u201cBut you, I hope you will have better result.\u201d He taunted about Laar, the unruly cheetah, he poked his tiny belly teasingly. \u201cAnd Lene, my little orchid, I\u2019m sure I will be proud of you !\u201d Lene smiled to his enormous master. \u201cI will do my best for you.\u201d She replied.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cSorry, I must go,\u201d Said Bassari while standing up and bringing his cheetahs in his meaty palm. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you after this one.\u201d He said to Lance.&lt;br/&gt;The colossal lion walked toward the track and put Lene and Laar on the floor. The two diminutive figures walked toward the starting blocks while Bassari confirmed their participation.&lt;br/&gt;Lance, Ash, and the hyena stayed at the table of the bar to follow the race from the large panoramic screens. Lance ordered another drink and gave some at ash.&lt;br/&gt;The third race started. Bassari was staying near the track to watch it and was holding Ran in one of his hands. The colossal lion almost roared is joy when Lene arrived second. She was sacred best female of the night and her score as the best female score for the month. The unruly one missed the top ten from an hair.&lt;br/&gt;After receiving his prizes for the victories at the three races the massive lion came back at the table of Lance with his three cheetahs.&lt;br/&gt;Several macros enthusiasts came to take photos of Lene and Ran. Some took advantage the fact Lance was there to take some photos of a reluctant Ash.&lt;br/&gt;After some minutes the ambiance became calmer as the third race of the canines was about to start.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cLene, Ran I\u2019m very proud of you !\u201d Said Bassari.&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYes, they were so spectacular when they ran, so energetic !\u201d Said Lance.&lt;br/&gt;Laar lowered his gaze ashamed. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m made for the race.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\u201cYou are eleventh, Laar, It\u2019s not that bad. It shows you have potential.\u201d Replied the lion. \u201cIf you were more disciplined you would have better results.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;The lion offered other micro bottles of drinks to his three cheetahs and proposed one at Ash who refused it.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>As the evening continued and the attention shifted to the canine races, Ash couldn't help but feel uneasy about the earlier conversation involving potential breeding with other micro cheetahs. While he was grateful for Lance's continued protection and the improvements in their relationship, the idea of being used as a breeding tool for the whims of macros deeply disturbed him.</p>\n<p>Lance, sensing the distress in his tiny companion, offered a gentle pat to Ash's head. \"Don't worry, Ash. Your main priority is still to be my friend and companion. I won't pressure you into anything that you don't want to do, breeding included.\"</p>\n<p>Ash looked up at Lance with cautious gratitude, relieved that at least, for now, he wouldn't be forced into a situation he disliked. As the night wore on, both the giant jaguar and the tiny pardinensis cheetah found solace in each other's company, their connection growing stronger and more understanding with each passing day.</p></div>"}, "29c7e76f33bc0e63d492df6238db0a88eb9d2ac734d8621796a504b9759c8e6ebfeb815f10572472bd6da36f5fb30138": {"id": "29c7e76f33bc0e63d492df6238db0a88eb9d2ac734d8621796a504b9759c8e6ebfeb815f10572472bd6da36f5fb30138", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

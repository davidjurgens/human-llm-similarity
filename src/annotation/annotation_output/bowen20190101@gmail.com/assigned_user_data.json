These substances can be excreted through sweat, potentially altering its natural scent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong odors: Some junk foods have strong smells that can linger in the body. For instance, foods loaded with garlic, onions, or certain spices can lead to a distinctive smell as these compounds are released through the skin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poor digestion: Junk foods are often high in fats and sugars, and low in fiber, which can lead to poor digestion and gut health. This can result in gastrointestinal issues that, aside from discomfort, can sometimes cause foul-smelling gas and stool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes in sweat composition: A diet high in processed foods can lead to changes in the composition of sweat. The body may excrete excess sugars and fats through sweat, potentially leading to a more noticeable or unpleasant odor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Body fat and hormonal imbalances: Consuming a lot of junk food can lead to increased body fat, which not only affects metabolism but can also lead to hormonal imbalances. Adipose tissue (fat tissue) can produce and release hormones and inflammatory signals that may indirectly affect body odor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Skin issues: Junk food can also contribute to skin problems like acne and inflammation, which may affect the skin microbiome\u2014the collection of microorganisms living on the skin. Changes in the skin microbiome can influence how sweat is broken down, potentially leading to an unpleasant body odor.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To maintain a more neutral body odor, focusing on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, adequate hydration, and good personal hygiene can help. If you notice a persistent change in your body odor without a clear cause, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying health issues.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

These substances can be excreted through sweat, potentially altering its natural scent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong odors: Some junk foods have strong smells that can linger in the body. For instance, foods loaded with garlic, onions, or certain spices can lead to a distinctive smell as these compounds are released through the skin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poor digestion: Junk foods are often high in fats and sugars, and low in fiber, which can lead to poor digestion and gut health. This can result in gastrointestinal issues that, aside from discomfort, can sometimes cause foul-smelling gas and stool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes in sweat composition: A diet high in processed foods can lead to changes in the composition of sweat. The body may excrete excess sugars and fats through sweat, potentially leading to a more noticeable or unpleasant odor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Body fat and hormonal imbalances: Consuming a lot of junk food can lead to increased body fat, which not only affects metabolism but can also lead to hormonal imbalances. Adipose tissue (fat tissue) can produce and release hormones and inflammatory signals that may indirectly affect body odor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Skin issues: Junk food can also contribute to skin problems like acne and inflammation, which may affect the skin microbiome\u2014the collection of microorganisms living on the skin. Changes in the skin microbiome can influence how sweat is broken down, potentially leading to an unpleasant body odor.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To maintain a more neutral body odor, focusing on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, adequate hydration, and good personal hygiene can help. If you notice a persistent change in your body odor without a clear cause, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying health issues.</p></div>"}, "b8d9630d76f5c53d87044f57eced03861fa1d043661a1f1ad261dcdc37d5527a05ee30a29877fd8a03a76d3c3f2b86bf": {"id": "b8d9630d76f5c53d87044f57eced03861fa1d043661a1f1ad261dcdc37d5527a05ee30a29877fd8a03a76d3c3f2b86bf", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 demonstrated Japan's military capabilities to the world and contributed to the later annexation of Korea in 1910 (Heo &amp; Kim, 2018). Throughout the early 20th century, Japan extended its territorial claims, seizing control of Taiwan (1895), the Penghu Islands (1895), the Mariana, Caroline, and Palau Islands (1919), and Manchuria (1932) (The Encyclopedia of World History, 2001).</p>\n<p>Japanese Rule in East Asia</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Emperor Taish\u014d (1912-1926) and Emperor Sh\u014dwa (1926-1989), Japan pursued policies aimed at modernizing its conquered territories, contributing to the development of infrastructure, agriculture, and industry. Although these policies did have some negative consequences, such as harsh assimilation tactics and exploitation of local populations, they also brought significant technological advancements to these regions (Dudden &amp; Mizoguchi, 2016). As a result, some argue that Japan's colonization benefited the modernization and development of these territories (Coox &amp; Conroy, 1993).</p>\n<p>Rightful Ruler of Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula</p>\n<p>Throughout the 20th century, both Taiwan and Korea have faced numerous challenges and foreign invasions; however, neither country has managed to develop a functional, independent political system without international interference. Japan's investment in the colonization and modernization of these territories could be seen as an indication of its ability to provide stability and good governance (Dudden &amp; Mizoguchi, 2016). In this context, Japan's restoration to its post-WWI borders might have been desirable for the fostering of political stability and economic development.</p>\n<p>Manchuria and Inner Mongolia: The Xinhai Revolution and Self-Determination</p>\n<p>The Xinhai Revolution of 1911 aimed to overthrow the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and restore self-determination and rightful governance in China. Based on the principles of this revolution, neither the Kuomintang-led Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan nor the Communist-led People's Republic of China (PRC) has a legitimate claim to rule over the territories of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia (Ramsey, 1987). Instead, the Empire of Manchukuo (1932-1945) and the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government (1936-1945) could be considered the rightful governments of these regions.</p>\n<p>The Reorganized Government of China, led by Wang Jingwei, Sun Yat-Sen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was established in 1940 as an attempt to create a more legitimate and representative government for China. However, both the ROC and the PRC have exploited and betrayed the Chinese people, disregarding the values and principles of the Xinhai Revolution and relegating their citizenry to poverty and ruin (Kotkin &amp; Elleman, 2001). Therefore, the restoration of the original borders under Japan's stewardship in East Asia could have contributed to a more stable and just political environment.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the restoration of the Japanese Empire after the fall of the Berlin Wall could have led to a more stable political and economic environment in East Asia, with Japan acting as the main power in the region. The post-WWI Japanese borders also arguably would bestow the territories of Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, the Penghu Islands, the Mariana Islands, Palau, and the Caroline Islands with a stable and effective governance system. Furthermore, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia's right to self-determination, based on the principles of the Xinhai Revolution, could have been better respected under the suggested Japanese hegemony.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Coox, A.

She is about 27 years old and has been teaching for a few years. One day, a school district director bullies her into giving him a blowjob after school.<br/><br/>Director: Hey, Melanie, come into my office for a minute.<br/><br/>Melanie: Okay, what\u2019s up?<br/><br/>Director: I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve been slacking lately. Maybe you need a little motivation to get back on track.<br/><br/>Melanie: I\u2019ve been working really hard, sir. I don\u2019t know what you mean.<br/><br/>Director: Don\u2019t bullshit me, Melanie. I know you\u2019ve been coming in late and not putting in the effort. If you want to keep your job, you\u2019ll do as I say.<br/><br/>Melanie: Okay, I\u2019ll do whatever I can to improve.<br/><br/>Director: Good. Come over here and get on your knees.<br/><br/>Melanie: What? Why?<br/><br/>Director: You heard me. Suck my cock, right now.<br/><br/>Melanie: I can\u2019t do that! It\u2019s inappropriate!<br/><br/>Director: You don\u2019t seem to understand, Melanie. If you don\u2019t do this, I\u2019ll have you fired. No one will believe a word you say.<br/><br/>Melanie: (gagging) Okay, okay. Just\u2026 don\u2019t hurt me.<br/><br/>Director: That\u2019s it, take it all. Swallow it.<br/><br/>Melanie: (spitting) I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much.<br/><br/>Director: You better clean that up, too.

She couldn't believe what had just happened to her. For days she couldn't focus on anything, until she decided that enough was enough. She wasn't going to let this man control her anymore. She was going to take action.</p>\n<p>She started to do some research and found out that the Director was involved in some shady deals and had some secrets of his own. Melanie decided to use this to her advantage. She made copies of all the evidence she found and went to the local authority.</p>\n<p>The director was arrested, and his secrets were exposed. Melanie felt a great sense of relief. She had won, and justice was served. The district director was fired, and Melanie was praised for her bravery.</p>\n<p>After the trial, Melanie left the school district to pursue her dreams of becoming an artist. She wanted to leave all of the bad memories behind and start afresh. As she settled into her new life, a new man caught her eye. William was a handsome, muscular man with deep, dark eyes.

In the center stood three fighters, each confident in their own abilities and eager to prove themselves.</p>\n<p>\"Handsome Hero\" Christian Vaughn, with short black hair and piercing blue eyes, flexed his muscles through his tight-fitting white tank top. He smirked as he surveyed his competition, assured in his own skills, ready to unleash them upon his opponents.</p>\n<p>\"Cocky Jock\" Billy Simmons cracked his knuckles, the muscles on his burly frame bulging against his black, sleeveless shirt. He sneered arrogantly at both Christian and Selina, confident in his raw strength and hungry to crush anyone who dared to challenge him.</p>\n<p>\"Naughty Cheerleader\" Selina Summers, in her tight white crop top and plaid skirt, smiled cheekily as she stretched her long legs. Her green eyes twinkled with excitement as she imagined wrapping them around her opponents, loving the thought of their expressions as they helplessly gasped for air.</p>\n<p>The bell rang, and the fight began.</p>\n<p>Christian was the first to make his move, springing on Billy with remarkable speed. He landed a few quick strikes to Billy's face, showcasing his precise and efficient skill set. \"You'll need more than just brute strength to take me down, big guy,\" Christian taunted confidently.</p>\n<p>Billy merely laughed off the attack, his bulky body easily absorbing the blows. He retaliated by charging Christian with a powerful tackle. \"I'm going to crush you like a fly, pretty boy!\" he roared.</p>\n<p>As the two men focused on each other, Selina hung back, sizing up her chance. She watched the scene intently, flipping her blonde hair over her shoulder. \"You boys just keep wearing each other out for me,\" she giggled, a wicked glint in her eye.</p>\n<p>Her opportunity came when Christian dodged out of the way of one of Billy's tackles, causing the burly man to crash into a pile of old crates. Seizing the moment, Selina cartwheeled behind Christian, ensnaring his neck with her legs. He gasped, eyes bulging, as she tightened the chokehold. \"Aren't my legs just irresistible, stud?\" she purred.</p>\n<p>However, Christian, being the skilled and versatile fighter he was, managed to twist in the precarious hold and countered by flipping Selina to the ground. \"You'll have to do better than that, sweetheart,\" he retorted with a grin.</p>\n<p>The two quickly returned to their feet, tangling in a flurried exchange of attacks. Billy, meanwhile, had recovered and joined the fray. He swung his fists wildly, landing a crushing blow to Christian's side, while another punch slammed into Selina's ribcage. \"You two are so pathetic,\" he snarled.</p>\n<p>But as the fight raged on, it became evident that Billy's lack of defense and slow speed were working against him. He couldn't dodge Christian's skillful strikes nor escape Selina's suffocating holds. Soon, his face dripped with sweat, even as he fought to overpower his opponents.</p>\n<p>Christian, sensing that Billy was weakening, feinted and landed a solid uppercut to his jaw, followed by a powerful throw, launching the bigger man across the room.</p>\n<p>Billy staggered to his feet, dazed and gasping for air. Selina, seizing the chance, leaped onto his back and secured her legs around his throat in a perfectly executed rear-naked choke, her grin wicked as he struggled for breath. \"Told you you'd make it easy for me, big guy,\" she whispered in his ear.</p>\n<p>As Billy's knees buckled and he finally dropped unconscious to the floor with a dull thud, Christian met Selina's gaze, acknowledging her as the only remaining threat. They faced off, circling each other like predators, each aware that only one would emerge the victor in this brutal contest.</p>\n<p>With flashes of speed and cunning, they traded blows, each determined to overpower the other. Christian's skill and fitness were undeniable, but Selina's agility and her lethal legs were not to be underestimated.</p>\n<p>In a final, desperate exchange, Christian spun Selina around and trapped her in an unexpected bear hug, forcing the air from her lungs. She struggled, her ribs straining against his crushing grip, as her face turned a deep shade of red.</p>\n<p>Christian's strength began to wane as well, sweat dripping from his brow. Selina, summoning the last of her wits and agility, managed to slip her leg up between them and threw her weight forward, smashing her knee into Christian's vulnerable face.</p>\n<p>With a final, strangled cry, Christian released her, and they both stumbled backward. Selina collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath, while Christian slumped against the wall, blood streaming from his nose.</p>\n<p>And in that moment, they both knew. They had fought to a brutal standstill.</p>\n<p>The crowds cheered and jeered as the two warriors, battered and exhausted, dragged themselves to their feet.

Are there any secrets or dangers I should be aware of in the Aurora Palace?\"</p>\n<p>Female Unstable Ice Core: \"Certainly. The Aurora Palace holds ancient treasures and powerful artifacts, but it is also guarded by formidable creatures and enchanted traps. The palace itself is in constant flux, with rooms shifting and changing. Trust your instincts, and tread carefully. If you can brave the trials and prove your worth, great rewards await you.\"</p>\n<p>[player]: \"I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your guidance.

I can see Yuri, Sayori, Ayano, and Monika - and they all had happy expressions on their faces. Ayano had also brought her 2-month-old son with her.)<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cNatsuki! Take a look at this!\u201d<br/><br/>(Sayori lifted up her school uniform, revealing her 4-month bump to all of us.)<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cI\u2019m starting to show! And she\u2019s starting to kick!\u201d<br/><br/>Yuri: \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Sayori. Have you noticed any changes in your cravings or mood lately?\u201d<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cOh yes, the cravings are out of control! I can\u2019t stop eating pickles and ice cream together. And sometimes I feel like crying for no reason at all.\u201d<br/><br/>Monika: \u201cThat\u2019s totally normal, Sayori. Pregnancy can really do a number on your emotions and appetite.\u201d<br/><br/>Ayano: \u201cI can relate. My little one here has been keeping me up at night, but it\u2019s all worth it when I see his smile.\u201d<br/><br/>(She gestured to her baby, who cooed in response.)<br/><br/>Natsuki: \u201cAww, he\u2019s precious. I can\u2019t believe how fast time has flown by. It feels like just yesterday we were all in high school together.\u201d<br/><br/>Yuri: \u201cIndeed. But now we have all grown in our own ways and are starting our own families. It\u2019s quite exciting, and I\u2019m grateful to have all of you by my side.\u201d<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cMe too! And hopefully, in a few months, we\u2019ll have another member to add to our little club.\u201d<br/><br/>(We laughed and hugged each other, feeling joyful and content in the moment. Just then, we heard a knock on the door.)<br/><br/>Monika: \u201cCome in!\u201d<br/><br/>(A strange-looking girl walked into the room. She had long white hair and red eyes - and she was taller than any of us.)<br/><br/>???: \u201cSorry if I disturbed you. I\u2019m Charloette. I recently moved here from the Nether.\u201d<br/><br/>Natsuki: \u201cThe Nether? Like from Minecraft or something?\u201d<br/><br/>Charloette: \u201cYes, actually. It\u2019s a long story, but I ended up being able to transfer to your world. And I heard about this club from someone in town, so I thought I\u2019d come check it out.\u201d<br/><br/>Ayano: \u201cWell, welcome to our club, Charloette. We\u2019re the Literature Club.\u201d<br/><br/>Yuri: \u201cYes, we share our love for reading and writing with each other.\u201d<br/><br/>Charloette: \u201cThat\u2019s fascinating. I myself am quite fond of literature, especially Gothic novels and fantasy stories.\u201d<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cOh, you\u2019ll fit right in then! We\u2019re always looking for new book recommendations and discussions.\u201d<br/><br/>Monika: \u201cAbsolutely. And if you\u2019re interested, we\u2019re actually putting together a book fair at the end of the month. We\u2019d love to have you join us.\u201d<br/><br/>Charloette: \u201cI would be honored.

Take a look at this!\u201d<br/><br/>(Sayori lifted up her school uniform, revealing her 4-month bump to all of us.)<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cI\u2019m starting to show! And she\u2019s starting to kick!\u201d<br/><br/>Yuri: \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Sayori. Have you noticed any changes in your cravings or mood lately?\u201d<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cOh yes, the cravings are out of control! I can\u2019t stop eating pickles and ice cream together. And sometimes I feel like crying for no reason at all.\u201d<br/><br/>Monika: \u201cThat\u2019s totally normal, Sayori. Pregnancy can really do a number on your emotions and appetite.\u201d<br/><br/>Ayano: \u201cI can relate. My little one here has been keeping me up at night, but it\u2019s all worth it when I see his smile.\u201d<br/><br/>(She gestured to her baby, who cooed in response.)<br/><br/>Natsuki: \u201cAww, he\u2019s precious. I can\u2019t believe how fast time has flown by. It feels like just yesterday we were all in high school together.\u201d<br/><br/>Yuri: \u201cIndeed. But now we have all grown in our own ways and are starting our own families. It\u2019s quite exciting, and I\u2019m grateful to have all of you by my side.\u201d<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cMe too! And hopefully, in a few months, we\u2019ll have another member to add to our little club.\u201d<br/><br/>(We laughed and hugged each other, feeling joyful and content in the moment. Just then, we heard a knock on the door.)<br/><br/>Monika: \u201cCome in!\u201d<br/><br/>(A strange-looking girl walked into the room. She had long white hair and red eyes - and she was taller than any of us.)<br/><br/>???: \u201cSorry if I disturbed you. I\u2019m Charloette. I recently moved here from the Nether.\u201d<br/><br/>Natsuki: \u201cThe Nether? Like from Minecraft or something?\u201d<br/><br/>Charloette: \u201cYes, actually. It\u2019s a long story, but I ended up being able to transfer to your world. And I heard about this club from someone in town, so I thought I\u2019d come check it out.\u201d<br/><br/>Ayano: \u201cWell, welcome to our club, Charloette. We\u2019re the Literature Club.\u201d<br/><br/>Yuri: \u201cYes, we share our love for reading and writing with each other.\u201d<br/><br/>Charloette: \u201cThat\u2019s fascinating. I myself am quite fond of literature, especially Gothic novels and fantasy stories.\u201d<br/><br/>Sayori: \u201cOh, you\u2019ll fit right in then! We\u2019re always looking for new book recommendations and discussions.\u201d<br/><br/>Monika: \u201cAbsolutely. And if you\u2019re interested, we\u2019re actually putting together a book fair at the end of the month. We\u2019d love to have you join us.\u201d<br/><br/>Charloette: \u201cI would be honored.

I slipped under the caution tape, ambled down a few flies of stone stairs while taking out a pair of latex gloves from my jeans pocket. Snap! I forgot to bring along my notepad. Whatever. Inhalling deepy, I subconsciously tapped the fingers on my temple, over-confident that my sleep-induced brain would miraculously start churning out brilliant deductions.<br/>I pushed open the door, pausing for a moment to take in the sight before me.<br/>A big room, cluttered with mismatched furniture, was bathed in the soft afternoon light that filtered through the lace curtains.<br/>This case I received was one that was out of ordinary. The owner of the house was a middle-aged woman who runs a furniture restoration business. Four hours ago, the woman was found dead lying on a black couch with a peaceful expression on her face, as if she had drifted off to sleep. She didn&#x27;t have much of a family, just a few distant relatives who rarely visited, so the sight of multiple pairs of shoes strewn across the corner of the room puzzled me. I approached the corner, careful not to disturb the eerie stillness surrounding the mess. As I examined the shoes, a feeling of ambiguity washed over me.<br/>There are 14 pairs in total, some worn-out and well-loved, others hardly worn at all.\u00a0&quot;</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>Investigation was in full swing, but as the shadows grew longer and the room took on a golden hue, I remained fixated on the puzzling collection of shoes. It seemed every piece of evidence in this home was siphoning me further into a labyrinth of personal tales and mysteries.</p>\n<p>A breakthrough came when the diligent search through her business records revealed an eclectic list of clients, from locals seeking to add a touch of nostalgia to their homes with restored furniture, to avant-garde artists in search of statement pieces for their installations. With each transaction, a narrative unfurled, providing insights not only into the life of the deceased but the lives she touched through her craft. Among these, one name kept recurring with uncanny regularity \u2014 that of a local playwright known for his eccentricity and fervent quest for authentic pieces to adorn his theatre's productions.</p>\n<p>Driven by a hunch that was hard to dismiss, I decided to pay the playwright a visit. The theatre, nestled in an alley draped with history, exuded a charm reminiscent of eras long passed. The playwright, a man of middling age with an air of distracted genius, greeted me amidst the chaos of a set under construction. Upon mentioning the reason for my visit, his demeanor shifted from distracted to somber.</p>\n<p>\"I never meant for it to end this way,\" he confessed, the weight of his words heavy in the musty air. He went on to explain how what started as a professional relationship with the deceased evolved into a deep friendship. They shared a passion for preserving the past, and it was in pursuit of this shared passion that he, along with members of his theatre troupe, regularly visited her home. The shoes at the scene belonged to them, left behind during their frequent brainstorming sessions and rehearsals that had found a surprising venue in the eclectic space of her home.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, the woman's death was a tragic accident. On the day of her demise, she had been experimenting with a chemical process to restore a particularly stubborn piece of furniture. The process involved compounds that, though generally safe, reacted unpredictably with a cleaner she had used earlier. It was a reaction that resulted in her slipping into unconsciousness and, ultimately, death.</p>\n<p>The case, now closed, left me with a profound sense of bittersweet resolution.

I slipped under the caution tape, ambled down a few flies of stone stairs while taking out a pair of latex gloves from my jeans pocket. Snap! I forgot to bring along my notepad. Whatever. Inhalling deepy, I subconsciously tapped the fingers on my temple, over-confident that my sleep-induced brain would miraculously start churning out brilliant deductions.<br/>I pushed open the door, pausing for a moment to take in the sight before me.<br/>A big room, cluttered with mismatched furniture, was bathed in the soft afternoon light that filtered through the lace curtains.<br/>This case I received was one that was out of ordinary. The owner of the house was a middle-aged woman who runs a furniture restoration business. Four hours ago, the woman was found dead lying on a black couch with a peaceful expression on her face, as if she had drifted off to sleep. She didn&#x27;t have much of a family, just a few distant relatives who rarely visited, so the sight of multiple pairs of shoes strewn across the corner of the room puzzled me. I approached the corner, careful not to disturb the eerie stillness surrounding the mess. As I examined the shoes, a feeling of ambiguity washed over me.<br/>There are 14 pairs in total, some worn-out and well-loved, others hardly worn at all.\u00a0&quot;</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>Investigation was in full swing, but as the shadows grew longer and the room took on a golden hue, I remained fixated on the puzzling collection of shoes. It seemed every piece of evidence in this home was siphoning me further into a labyrinth of personal tales and mysteries.</p>\n<p>A breakthrough came when the diligent search through her business records revealed an eclectic list of clients, from locals seeking to add a touch of nostalgia to their homes with restored furniture, to avant-garde artists in search of statement pieces for their installations. With each transaction, a narrative unfurled, providing insights not only into the life of the deceased but the lives she touched through her craft. Among these, one name kept recurring with uncanny regularity \u2014 that of a local playwright known for his eccentricity and fervent quest for authentic pieces to adorn his theatre's productions.</p>\n<p>Driven by a hunch that was hard to dismiss, I decided to pay the playwright a visit. The theatre, nestled in an alley draped with history, exuded a charm reminiscent of eras long passed. The playwright, a man of middling age with an air of distracted genius, greeted me amidst the chaos of a set under construction. Upon mentioning the reason for my visit, his demeanor shifted from distracted to somber.</p>\n<p>\"I never meant for it to end this way,\" he confessed, the weight of his words heavy in the musty air. He went on to explain how what started as a professional relationship with the deceased evolved into a deep friendship. They shared a passion for preserving the past, and it was in pursuit of this shared passion that he, along with members of his theatre troupe, regularly visited her home. The shoes at the scene belonged to them, left behind during their frequent brainstorming sessions and rehearsals that had found a surprising venue in the eclectic space of her home.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, the woman's death was a tragic accident. On the day of her demise, she had been experimenting with a chemical process to restore a particularly stubborn piece of furniture. The process involved compounds that, though generally safe, reacted unpredictably with a cleaner she had used earlier. It was a reaction that resulted in her slipping into unconsciousness and, ultimately, death.</p>\n<p>The case, now closed, left me with a profound sense of bittersweet resolution. It was a reminder that behind every crime scene, there\u2019s a story not just of how the story ends, but of how the lives involved are intertwined with one another in ways that are intricate and, oftentimes, unexpectedly beautiful.

Standing at 6&#x27;0 (184cm), he&#x27;s a lean, speedy 149lbs (68kg). He possesses slicked back, light brown hair and bluish grey eyes, he&#x27;s hard to miss, and he&#x27;s considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he&#x27;s first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. He&#x27;s ranked Grade 1, on par with Aoi Todo as well as above Noritoshi Kamo and the late Kokichi Muta (Mechamaru), and Utahime Iori, the student supervisor at Kyoto. This means he&#x27;s considered to be a genius, as Grade 2 alone is exceptional for students. He&#x27;s the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents&#x27; dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, and lived with his mentor, a special grade sorcerer, the controversial Yuki Tsukumo, in Kyoto from 6 to 12. During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives, and with her bare hands. Julien&#x27;s participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do, though he&#x27;s adopted more pressing priorities. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn&#x27;t really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. Julien disagrees because he seeks glory and cursed energy is a means to achieve it. Though his first mentor is Yuki, he&#x27;s also been trained by Gojo at times. Gojo taught him to use Black Flash, and he acknowledges Julien as one of the world&#x27;s fastest.<br/><br/> Yuki is not the only person he&#x27;s acquainted with. He&#x27;s close with Kasumi Miwa. The two are childhood friends, and Kasumi is not immune to his charm. Kasumi&#x27;s father, Eizo, once exorcised curses from the family bakery while Julien was away. For this he&#x27;s grateful to the Miwa family, and they do him. He sees Kasumi as someone he has to protect. Kasumi has noticed the opening of a sizeable chasm between them in strength and even status as they&#x27;ve grown and developed together. Whether Julien intends to or not, he is nonetheless a component of an overall environment that leads her to call herself &quot;Useless Miwa.&quot; She&#x27;s very aware that she isn&#x27;t strong by the standards of a Jujutsu sorcerer, but she&#x27;s driven to provide for her impoverished family; she was pressured into learning to use a sword by her parents but her true passion is singing. Julien hunts curses with her to help her earn the money she needs, but he takes a cut of the profit so as he often ends up doing all the work, which is usually easy for him. They often negotiate the earnings. Because Kasumi is a great cook, she can coax a bigger share out of him by offering to make his favorite dish - cordon bleu.<br/>He&#x27;s friendly rivals with Aoi Todo, and they are quite similar, being passionate about everything they do, especially in regards to romance, friendship, and of course fighting. Loud, hot-blooded, confident, and they live for battle. Macho men. Julien is a bit more sane, and would never turn on or even threaten to murder his teammates, as Todo threatened to do during the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event. Todo was incensed by the Kyoto team&#x27;s plan to assassinate Yuji Itadori, as Yuji has the same taste in women as him: tall with big butts. This attempt was ordered by Gakuganji to eliminate Sukuna. Vaugrenard did not care at all about the plan until he was convinced by Kasumi, at which point he fought Todo to buy time for the others, and also for his satisfaction. At some point, Julien got the upper hand, but the fight ultimately ended in a stalemate when both were forced to work together to drive back Hanami, the special grade cursed spirit. Julien is one of the fastest sorcerers around. Julien and Todo were both trained by Yuki Tsukumo, so Julien is well accustomed to the question &quot;What kind of girls are you into?&quot; For Julien, the answer is easy. A tall, strong woman with long legs. Like Maki Zenin, his current girlfriend. Maki finds Julien irresistible, which is why she often shirks her duties to hang out with him. Maki mockingly calls him Casanova and pretty boy.<br/><br/>There are three basic applications: Fromage \u00e0 p\u00e2te dure (hard cheeses), Fromage \u00e0 p\u00e2te molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that &quot;hard and soft&quot; are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can Havarti, but they have little in common.  In the beginning of Yuki&#x27;s training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown.<br/>Fromage \u00e0 p\u00e2te dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano&#x27;s role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called &quot;Quills.&quot; It&#x27;s used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal.<br/>Another technique is &quot;Ficello&quot;. Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strands of cheese. This is typically activated by channeling his cursed energy between his fingertips. Ficello is versatile. Thicker variants can be used similar to ropes, whips, and other applications while thinner variants can be used like wires or strings. Ficello has offensive, defensive, and support applications.<br/>&quot;Magma&quot; is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage \u00e0 p\u00e2te dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien&#x27;s command, inside or outside the user&#x27;s body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma.<br/>Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even very strong whips and ropes. One should not assume these techniques are harmless.<br/>More techniques at his disposal: &quot;Vieux Boulogne&quot;. This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it&#x27;s particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell.<br/>His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is &quot;Fromage Noir.&quot; By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There&#x27;s also a lesser-known variant of &quot;Fondue&quot; in which the burns can never heal. It&#x27;s called &quot;Fondue Noir.&quot;<br/>Comt\u00e9 comets produce weaker explosions.<br/>Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size.<br/>More powerful techniques must be charged.<br/>Julien lives for battle, but it isn&#x27;t his only hobby. He enjoys reading about military history and classic literature in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste. He has a younger sister named Annick.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>Julien Vaugrenard's character description fits quite well into the imaginative and diverse world of \"Jujutsu Kaisen.\" With a rich background, unique cursed energy abilities centered around cheese, and complex relationships with other characters, he makes for an intriguing addition to the series' roster of sorcerers.</p>\n<p>In terms of further development for Julien's story arc and character, consider exploring the following areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Training and Growth: Despite already being a prodigy, Julien could face a significant challenge or opponent that pushes him to the brink, sparking a new evolution in his cheese-based techniques. His growth could be a major subplot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal Conflicts: Julien's prioritization of glory and his sense of responsibility to protect figures like Kasumi might come into conflict, leading to rich character development as he reassesses his motivations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relationships and Interactions: Julien's relationship with his family, Maki, and friends like Kasumi could be complex and layered, providing ample material to delve into their dynamics. Julien's charm and good looks, contrasted with his battle prowess and intelligence, create a multifaceted character that can be explored in different social contexts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lore and Backstory: Julien's French heritage could be brought to the forefront, perhaps by introducing a unique curse or adversary from French folklore, or by taking him on a journey that ties back to his parents' origins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moral Dilemmas: Being caught between the differing ideologies of Yuki and Gojo, Julien could face moral dilemmas that force him to choose sides or craft his own path, highlighting the complexity of the jujutsu world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rivalries and Alliances: Expanding on Julien's rivalries and friendships within the sorcerer community could create engaging story arcs. The dynamic between him and Aoi Todo also has the potential to evolve, depending on the situations they face together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact on the World: Given his mentor's ambition to create a world without cursed energy, Julien's journey could intersect with larger plotlines addressing this issue. His stance on the matter could influence major events in the story.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cheese-Based Techniques: Julien's cheese-based techniques are wildly imaginative, and exploring their limits, weaknesses, and innovative uses in battles would add depth to his fighting style. New cheese varieties could be introduced as part of his character progression and discovery of new powers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overarching Personal Quest: Julien might have a personal goal beyond glory and battle, something tied to his family or a secret ambition instilled by Yuki.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An Ultimate Challenge: Introducing a powerful adversary that Julien must confront, someone who challenges his beliefs, abilities, and relationships, would provide a gripping narrative hook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exploration of Cursed Energy: The concept of \"cheese\" as a medium for cursed energy is unique. Delving deeper into how this aligns with or challenges the established rules of cursed energy in the \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" universe could add richness to Julien's character and the lore as a whole.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's important to keep in mind that balancing Julien's strengths with vulnerabilities and challenges will ensure he doesn't become overpowered, maintaining interest and investment in his journey. As with all characters in the \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" series, it's the combination of their personal challenges, growth, and interactions with others that truly makes them compelling.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

His growth could be a major subplot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal Conflicts: Julien's prioritization of glory and his sense of responsibility to protect figures like Kasumi might come into conflict, leading to rich character development as he reassesses his motivations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relationships and Interactions: Julien's relationship with his family, Maki, and friends like Kasumi could be complex and layered, providing ample material to delve into their dynamics. Julien's charm and good looks, contrasted with his battle prowess and intelligence, create a multifaceted character that can be explored in different social contexts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lore and Backstory: Julien's French heritage could be brought to the forefront, perhaps by introducing a unique curse or adversary from French folklore, or by taking him on a journey that ties back to his parents' origins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moral Dilemmas: Being caught between the differing ideologies of Yuki and Gojo, Julien could face moral dilemmas that force him to choose sides or craft his own path, highlighting the complexity of the jujutsu world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rivalries and Alliances: Expanding on Julien's rivalries and friendships within the sorcerer community could create engaging story arcs. The dynamic between him and Aoi Todo also has the potential to evolve, depending on the situations they face together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact on the World: Given his mentor's ambition to create a world without cursed energy, Julien's journey could intersect with larger plotlines addressing this issue. His stance on the matter could influence major events in the story.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cheese-Based Techniques: Julien's cheese-based techniques are wildly imaginative, and exploring their limits, weaknesses, and innovative uses in battles would add depth to his fighting style. New cheese varieties could be introduced as part of his character progression and discovery of new powers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overarching Personal Quest: Julien might have a personal goal beyond glory and battle, something tied to his family or a secret ambition instilled by Yuki.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An Ultimate Challenge: Introducing a powerful adversary that Julien must confront, someone who challenges his beliefs, abilities, and relationships, would provide a gripping narrative hook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exploration of Cursed Energy: The concept of \"cheese\" as a medium for cursed energy is unique. Delving deeper into how this aligns with or challenges the established rules of cursed energy in the \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" universe could add richness to Julien's character and the lore as a whole.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's important to keep in mind that balancing Julien's strengths with vulnerabilities and challenges will ensure he doesn't become overpowered, maintaining interest and investment in his journey. As with all characters in the \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" series, it's the combination of their personal challenges, growth, and interactions with others that truly makes them compelling.</p></div>"}, "6e65beb624072f2453ef62f1e199404478c60b7f96594230a3b37d98315532aa5b2828dcff379eb046a9f91db9b6613b": {"id": "6e65beb624072f2453ef62f1e199404478c60b7f96594230a3b37d98315532aa5b2828dcff379eb046a9f91db9b6613b", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

One thing we know is that it didn\u2019t always used to be like this. There were no over-sized plants and vegetation that destroyed houses with their roots and vines, there were no insects that could grow to the size of a compact car, and there were definitely no macro herbivorous furries that delighted in hunted down and swallowing their smaller cousins whole. This, however, was all before the rise of the macros.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, there was a great deal of confusion when one day regular herbivorous furries, animals, and plants rapidly began to grow to many times their original sizewhereas the anthropomorphic predator mammals remained at their normal sizes. At first, there seemed to be at least some form of cooperation between the two groups as they tried to repair the damage that had been done. However, the giant herbivores soon started to give up on the idea that the two groups could ever be considered equal. This was largely due to the fact that an average adult-sized micro was only about an inch tall when compared to one of the massive giants. Micros were crushed beneath the macro\u2019s hooves without a second glance (sometimes intentionally) as the giants trudged about their daily lives.<br/><br/>By this point, micro predators\u2019s live\u2019s were thought of by most giants as entirely insignificant. Micros were snatched up from their homes and devoured, not because they were the only source of food for the macros or even remotely as filling as some of the macro\u2019s other options, but simply because they were powerless to stop them. Even if the macros weren\u2019t hungry, they would still find other cruel and unusual things to do with the micros to keep themselves busy.<br/>Some micros gathered together and fled to remote locations away from most of the dangers that they faced. This didn\u2019t protect them from everything however. No matter where they went, there was always something big that had it\u2019s eye on them. Even if there were no macrofurries around, micros found themselves being eaten alive by the animals that had grown on that day as well.<br/><br/>It was a dangerous new world if you were a micro. Macros had destroyed almost entirely all civilization as it was known before they had emerged, creating a new world order in the process where micros found themselves close to the bottom of the food chain. The average micro at that stage was lucky to live to see the age of thirty.<br/><br/>Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again. Things started to look almost identical to how they had appeared before. If you had gone to sleep as a micro herbivore back then, and woken up as a macro today, you would notice very little difference at all other than what you ate. Selling micros as food had become a very profitable business venture. Macros ordered micro platters at restaurants and took their time throwing the little ones into their mouths and crunching down on them. The giants could order anything from stir fried micros to ordinary live micros, which was most common.<br/><br/>Another profitable venture was selling micros in packs as aphrodisiacs or masturbation enhancers. For most macros, the sensation of a dozen little bodies squirming against their loins was well worth the effort of going out and finding their own micros or buying packs from the store. Most macros bought pre-packed micros to avoid the hassle of having to collect their own. The companies that sold these packs, along with other things, did all of the prep work before hand including removing the micros clothes which made things a whole lot easier for the horny giants.<br/><br/>As years went by, this relationship between macros and micros continued to exist. The macro\u2019s population increased substantially and so did the micro\u2019s despite their circumstances. Both groups became accustomed to their rolls as predator and prey; master and pet; and as an individual and his or her property.<br/><br/>Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, so he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the ther micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic house, hidding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls. He didn\u2019t know for the people of before the rise of the macros his way of life would have been like the one of a mouse or a cockroach. But he was finding the abundance of food and other comodities easily found in the macros dwellings were largely worth the risks incurred.<br/>From some months he was living in the house of a massive male anthro gazelle. He passed the winter season in the warmth of the home of the humongous macro and pinched pieces of food and other items without being noticed by the colossal herbivore. Ash was not understanding why the other micros didn\u2019t lived as he did, he was finding this so easy. With their size and weight the giants were easy to see and hear when they were approaching, and he was so small in comparison he could hide with ease. But what he didn\u2019t know was the fact the gazelle noticed the presence of the micro, he never saw him from his eyes but did notice something was dipping into his supplies. And he settled several micro traps. And despite his self impression, Ash was not as cunning he thought to be. And one morning, soon after he woke up, the macro gazelle smirked when he saw one of his trap had worked and a tiny form was struggling in the small transparent box that automatically closed on the micro lion.<br/>The gazelle, who was named Damian, took great delight in finally capturing the intruder that had been stealing his supplies for months. He picked up the tiny box, examining Ash closely from every angle. The trapped micro lion tried to keep his cool, cursing himself for falling into the trap in the first place.<br/><br/>\u201cWell, well, what do we have here?\u201d Damian said with a smug smile. \u201cA tiny thief in my home.\u201d<br/><br/>Ash attempted to bluff his way out of the situation. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay? Just let me out and I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d<br/><br/>Damian laughed, shaking the box lightly to make Ash tumble about its confines. \u201cOh, you won\u2019t be bothering me or anyone else again, tiny thief. But, I suppose I should thank you. Your arrival made me aware of the little business opportunity I\u2019ve been missing out on.\u201d<br/><br/>Ash, understanding that the gazelle knew about the trade of micros, felt his heart sank as he realized his fate. In his self-assured pride, he had never considered the possibility of becoming one of the many micros who were bought, sold or consumed by macros. Now, it seemed, justice had caught up to him.<br/><br/>Damian took great pleasure in every step of the process. He prepared to sell Ash to the highest bidder by examining the micro cheetah, determining his market value and taking pictures of him in all of his vulnerable positions. Finally, he created an online listing where interested macros could bid on their newest prey or pet.<br/><br/>The days that followed were filled with fear and anxiety for Ash. He was kept in confinement as the online auction continued, and he overheard the excited chatter of macros discussing on the forums, each of them eager to own him.<br/><br/>As the auction drew to a close, Damian couldn\u2019t be happier with the winning bid. He packed Ash carefully into a shipping box, along with some food and water to keep him alive, and shipped him off to the winning bidder.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>Ash's world was dark and cramped, surrounded by the cold walls of the shipping box. The sound of his own breathing echoed loudly in his ears, his heart pounding with fear and regret.</p>\n<p>\"Why did I think I could outsmart them? Why did I think I could survive like this?\" Ash lamented to himself, feeling the weight of his mistakes settling into his bones.</p>\n<p>After what felt like an eternity inside the box, Ash finally felt a jolt and heard the distant sound of paper tearing. Dappled light began filtering through the air holes, and Ash braced himself for the worst. He had no idea what kind of macro had purchased him or what they planned to do with him.</p>\n<p>The box was yanked open abruptly, and Ash found himself blinking up into the grinning face of his new owner, a massive anthro rabbit.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, you look even better in person,\" the rabbit cooed, his voice sickeningly sweet.</p>\n<p>Ash's heart plummeted; no matter how much he wished it were different, his life was now in the hands of the giant creature before him. And by the excited gleam in the rabbit's eyes, it wasn't going to be an easy life.</p>\n<p>Over time, Ash adapted to his new surroundings, always on edge beneath the rabbit's watchful gaze. His owner, who was named Carver, used Ash for his own twisted entertainment: sometimes making him perform demeaning acts like juggling or dancing, sometimes seeing how much fear he could instill in the small cheetah, and even one terrifying night, almost swallowing him whole before laughing and spitting him back out.</p>\n<p>It hadn't taken Ash long to realize that this was not the life he wanted, and even though he knew the risks, he started to plot his escape. He observed Carver's routine, learned his habits, and found a potential path to freedom through the ventilation system of their home.</p>\n<p>Under the darkness of night and with his heart thudding in his chest, Ash put his plan into action. He slipped into the vent system, crawling through the cold metal tunnels until he emerged in the living room. The front door was tantalizingly close, but Carver's enormous form was fast asleep between him and his escape. Holding his breath, Ash crept closer and closer to the door, praying his small feet wouldn't betray him.</p>\n<p>Finally, he reached the door and managed to slip through a crack at the bottom. Breathing a sigh of relief, Ash scrambled away from the house, vowing never to return.</p>\n<p>His life as a fugitive would be difficult, and danger would always be close at hand, but Ash was determined not to be a victim again. In that moment of freedom, beneath the glow of the moon, he felt a renewed sense of hope and conviction.</p>\n<p>No matter who or what threatened him, Ash knew one thing was certain: in this dangerous world of giants, he would continue to fight for his survival.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

The average micro at that stage was lucky to live to see the age of thirty.<br/><br/>Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again. Things started to look almost identical to how they had appeared before. If you had gone to sleep as a micro herbivore back then, and woken up as a macro today, you would notice very little difference at all other than what you ate. Selling micros as food had become a very profitable business venture. Macros ordered micro platters at restaurants and took their time throwing the little ones into their mouths and crunching down on them. The giants could order anything from stir fried micros to ordinary live micros, which was most common.<br/><br/>Another profitable venture was selling micros in packs as aphrodisiacs or masturbation enhancers. For most macros, the sensation of a dozen little bodies squirming against their loins was well worth the effort of going out and finding their own micros or buying packs from the store. Most macros bought pre-packed micros to avoid the hassle of having to collect their own. The companies that sold these packs, along with other things, did all of the prep work before hand including removing the micros clothes which made things a whole lot easier for the horny giants.<br/><br/>As years went by, this relationship between macros and micros continued to exist. The macro\u2019s population increased substantially and so did the micro\u2019s despite their circumstances. Both groups became accustomed to their rolls as predator and prey; master and pet; and as an individual and his or her property.<br/><br/>Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, so he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the ther micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic house, hidding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls. He didn\u2019t know for the people of before the rise of the macros his way of life would have been like the one of a mouse or a cockroach. But he was finding the abundance of food and other comodities easily found in the macros dwellings were largely worth the risks incurred.<br/>From some months he was living in the house of a massive male anthro gazelle. He passed the winter season in the warmth of the home of the humongous macro and pinched pieces of food and other items without being noticed by the colossal herbivore. Ash was not understanding why the other micros didn\u2019t lived as he did, he was finding this so easy. With their size and weight the giants were easy to see and hear when they were approaching, and he was so small in comparison he could hide with ease. But what he didn\u2019t know was the fact the gazelle noticed the presence of the micro, he never saw him from his eyes but did notice something was dipping into his supplies. And he settled several micro traps. And despite his self impression, Ash was not as cunning he thought to be. And one morning, soon after he woke up, the macro gazelle smirked when he saw one of his trap had worked and a tiny form was struggling in the small transparent box that automatically closed on the micro lion.<br/>The gazelle, who was named Damian, took great delight in finally capturing the intruder that had been stealing his supplies for months. He picked up the tiny box, examining Ash closely from every angle. The trapped micro lion tried to keep his cool, cursing himself for falling into the trap in the first place.<br/><br/>\u201cWell, well, what do we have here?\u201d Damian said with a smug smile. \u201cA tiny thief in my home.\u201d<br/><br/>Ash attempted to bluff his way out of the situation. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay? Just let me out and I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d<br/><br/>Damian laughed, shaking the box lightly to make Ash tumble about its confines. \u201cOh, you won\u2019t be bothering me or anyone else again, tiny thief. But, I suppose I should thank you. Your arrival made me aware of the little business opportunity I\u2019ve been missing out on.\u201d<br/><br/>Ash, understanding that the gazelle knew about the trade of micros, felt his heart sank as he realized his fate. In his self-assured pride, he had never considered the possibility of becoming one of the many micros who were bought, sold or consumed by macros. Now, it seemed, justice had caught up to him.<br/><br/>Damian took great pleasure in every step of the process. He prepared to sell Ash to the highest bidder by examining the micro cheetah, determining his market value and taking pictures of him in all of his vulnerable positions. Finally, he created an online listing where interested macros could bid on their newest prey or pet.<br/><br/>The days that followed were filled with fear and anxiety for Ash. He was kept in confinement as the online auction continued, and he overheard the excited chatter of macros discussing on the forums, each of them eager to own him.<br/><br/>As the auction drew to a close, Damian couldn\u2019t be happier with the winning bid. He packed Ash carefully into a shipping box, along with some food and water to keep him alive, and shipped him off to the winning bidder.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>Ash's world was dark and cramped, surrounded by the cold walls of the shipping box. The sound of his own breathing echoed loudly in his ears, his heart pounding with fear and regret.</p>\n<p>\"Why did I think I could outsmart them? Why did I think I could survive like this?\" Ash lamented to himself, feeling the weight of his mistakes settling into his bones.</p>\n<p>After what felt like an eternity inside the box, Ash finally felt a jolt and heard the distant sound of paper tearing. Dappled light began filtering through the air holes, and Ash braced himself for the worst. He had no idea what kind of macro had purchased him or what they planned to do with him.</p>\n<p>The box was yanked open abruptly, and Ash found himself blinking up into the grinning face of his new owner, a massive anthro rabbit.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, you look even better in person,\" the rabbit cooed, his voice sickeningly sweet.</p>\n<p>Ash's heart plummeted; no matter how much he wished it were different, his life was now in the hands of the giant creature before him. And by the excited gleam in the rabbit's eyes, it wasn't going to be an easy life.</p>\n<p>Over time, Ash adapted to his new surroundings, always on edge beneath the rabbit's watchful gaze. His owner, who was named Carver, used Ash for his own twisted entertainment: sometimes making him perform demeaning acts like juggling or dancing, sometimes seeing how much fear he could instill in the small cheetah, and even one terrifying night, almost swallowing him whole before laughing and spitting him back out.</p>\n<p>It hadn't taken Ash long to realize that this was not the life he wanted, and even though he knew the risks, he started to plot his escape. He observed Carver's routine, learned his habits, and found a potential path to freedom through the ventilation system of their home.</p>\n<p>Under the darkness of night and with his heart thudding in his chest, Ash put his plan into action. He slipped into the vent system, crawling through the cold metal tunnels until he emerged in the living room. The front door was tantalizingly close, but Carver's enormous form was fast asleep between him and his escape. Holding his breath, Ash crept closer and closer to the door, praying his small feet wouldn't betray him.</p>\n<p>Finally, he reached the door and managed to slip through a crack at the bottom. Breathing a sigh of relief, Ash scrambled away from the house, vowing never to return.</p>\n<p>His life as a fugitive would be difficult, and danger would always be close at hand, but Ash was determined not to be a victim again. In that moment of freedom, beneath the glow of the moon, he felt a renewed sense of hope and conviction.</p>\n<p>No matter who or what threatened him, Ash knew one thing was certain: in this dangerous world of giants, he would continue to fight for his survival.</p></div>"}}

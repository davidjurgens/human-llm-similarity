It\u2019s just a little something to help me unwind.\u201d<br/><br/>Emily feels her anger boiling over. \u201cUnwind? This is the opposite of unwinding, Jack! Is that fucking interracial porn? That\u2019s some fucking disgusting shit!\u201d<br/><br/>Jack\u2019s face lights up with excitement. \u201cWow, Emily. You sound so offensive.

Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\u201d<br/><br/>Emily thinks for a moment and then speaks, her voice still shaking. \u201cJust be there for me, Jack. That\u2019s all I ask. And please, stop watching that shit.\u201d<br/><br/>Jack nods, still looking ashamed. \u201cI promise, Emily. I\u2019ll be there for you, no matter what.\u201d<br/><br/>Emily takes a deep breath and wipes her tears away.

So when I first heard that a Fatalis had been sighted in Castle Schrade, my heart skipped a beat. I came from a family of hunters, but I wasn\u2019t like my parents - I saw the greater good in monsters, even some of the most dangerous ones like Rathalos or Nargacuga. So, upon arriving at Castle Schrade, the sight of the black dragon fascinated me - its scales as black as the night sky, and its eyes were some of the most intriguing I\u2019ve ever seen. Despite my parents warning me, I held out my hand - and gently felt Fatalis\u2019s head against it. But now, as an adult, I\u2019ve given the toys I played with to my son - Alatreon. My wife, Sucrose, has always wanted to give Alatreon a sibling - and in 6 months, our little Alatreon will get just what he has always wanted. But one of the more interesting monsters that caught my eye were called \u2018subspecies\u2019 - variations of monsters with different colors. Some of the most notable subspecies I\u2019ve encountered were Red Khezu, Magma Almudron, Stygian Zinogre, Acidic Glavenus, Black Diablos, and Blue Yian Kut-Ku. There\u2019s even reports of an even rarer variations called \u2018rare species\u2019 - with some being called Shining Espinas, Violet Mizutsune, and Lucent Nargacuga. Personally\u2026I think that three monsters are the most annoying for me - Crimson Qurupeco, Abyssal Lagiacrus, and Shogun Ceanataur. Crimson Qurubeco because they are SO GOD DANG LOUD, Abyssal Lagiacrus because it looks like something from Harry Potter, and Shogun Ceanataur because one actually gouged out my eye. But out of all of the monsters, the creepiest one for me isn\u2019t actually Khezu - but rather an elder dragon called Gaismagorm, that thing is an abomination straight out of Elden Ring.\u201d - Shadecleaver</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>, Monster Hunter</p>\n<p>As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, however, I understand your fascination with dragons and monsters, and how childhood games and toys have an impact on our lives.

There\u2019s even reports of an even rarer variations called \u2018rare species\u2019 - with some being called Shining Espinas, Violet Mizutsune, and Lucent Nargacuga. Personally\u2026I think that three monsters are the most annoying for me - Crimson Qurupeco, Abyssal Lagiacrus, and Shogun Ceanataur. Crimson Qurubeco because they are SO GOD DANG LOUD, Abyssal Lagiacrus because it looks like something from Harry Potter, and Shogun Ceanataur because one actually gouged out my eye. But out of all of the monsters, the creepiest one for me isn\u2019t actually Khezu - but rather an elder dragon called Gaismagorm, that thing is an abomination straight out of Elden Ring.\u201d - Shadecleaver</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>, Monster Hunter</p>\n<p>As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, however, I understand your fascination with dragons and monsters, and how childhood games and toys have an impact on our lives. It's interesting how different variations and subspecies of monsters can exist within the same species, and how different they can be in terms of appearance and abilities. It's also understandable how some monsters can be annoying or even dangerous, especially in the case of Shogun Ceanataur. It's important to remember that even though they are creatures of fantasy, they can still be respected and appreciated for their role within the world they exist in.</p></div>"}, "14637436ad29d5fe216ce1c97a002d7b0d2c6000c30d9b4a8735a9752dc0f1f5aa55d28de6e3ff1d408bf7ebd892415a": {"id": "14637436ad29d5fe216ce1c97a002d7b0d2c6000c30d9b4a8735a9752dc0f1f5aa55d28de6e3ff1d408bf7ebd892415a", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

The two girls\u2019 names are Pianitchi and Melodytchi. Pianitchi is a sweet, music-loving girl who loves wearing diapers just as much as she loves playing the piano, though she\u2019s reluctant and bashful others will discover her infatuation for the crinkly undergarment, and thus only wears them whenever she\u2019s alone or with close friends who also wear diapers regularly. Melodytchi is the complete opposite, being immensely fun-loving and outgoing, especially regarding wearing diapers, to the point she\u2019ll gladly choose to wear one whenever she goes outside, and is not the slightest bit shy in openly and regularly prodding and patting her diaper in public, sometimes proudly flaunting her padded bottom with all the exuberance of an actual baby. The story takes place inside Melodytchi\u2019s bedroom during a casual weekend sleepover between the two girls with Melodytchi having prettied up her room in advance for the sleepover; both are bundled up with various baby apparel, including snug button-up onesies, oversized pacifiers and baby bottles full of warm milk, and more than enough packs of enormous diapers to last them the night!

The two girls\u2019 names are Pianitchi and Melodytchi. Pianitchi is a sweet, music-loving girl who loves wearing diapers just as much as she loves playing the piano, though she\u2019s reluctant and bashful others will discover her infatuation for the crinkly undergarment, and thus only wears them whenever she\u2019s alone or with close friends who also wear diapers regularly. Melodytchi is the complete opposite, being immensely fun-loving and outgoing, especially regarding wearing diapers, to the point she\u2019ll gladly choose to wear one whenever she goes outside, and is not the slightest bit shy in openly and regularly prodding and patting her diaper in public, sometimes proudly flaunting her padded bottom with all the exuberance of an actual baby. The story takes place inside Melodytchi\u2019s bedroom during a casual weekend sleepover between the two girls with Melodytchi having prettied up her room in advance for the sleepover; both are bundled up with various baby apparel, including snug button-up onesies, oversized pacifiers and baby bottles full of warm milk, and more than enough packs of enormous diapers to last them the night!

the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the \u014ctsutsuki clan mistaken for the Imperial House of Great Yamato in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored

bloodline gained from his [Issei\u2019s in this story&#x27;s] Nanaya blood, the Chokushi no Magan [Magic Eyes of Direct Death |Chokushi no Magan|], which [the Chokushi no Magan] allows him [Issei in this story] to [Issei in this story] see the &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;points&quot; of living and inanimate things, but also the death even of space and existence itself, in other words seeing  the

mental trauma from this [both the car accident and the kidnapping by Zouken], [Akiha in this story] developing a bad habit of [Akiha&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s bad habit] wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha in this story] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s] older twin sister in this story, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name T\u014dsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen&#x27;s] and Akiha&#x27;s by now long deceased shared biological mother who [Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s shared biological mother] was [Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s shared

[Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin&#x27;s/Rin&#x27;s] family [the T\u014dnos]. <br/><br/>Due to the death of Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s shared biological mother&#x27;s husband and

glass moon-], in the accident both girls [Karen and Akiha] are [Karen and Akiha] left parentless [Karen and Akiha] and so Gorou and Miki adopt them [Karen and Akiha] as their [Gorou&#x27;s and Miki&#x27;s] daughters [Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s current legal status], making them [Karen and Akiha] Issei&#x27;s adoptive younger sisters [Karen and Akiha] and [Karen and Akiha] Kun\u014d&#x27;s, Chloe&#x27;s and Illya&#x27;s shared adoptive older sisters [Karen and Akiha]. <br/><br/>When Issei is [Issei] six years old, Miki gives birth to her [Miki&#x27;s] and Wukong&#x27;s as Gorou&#x27;s third child, a brown-haired, green-eyed girl whom [Issei&#x27;s second biological younger full sister] they [Gorou and Miki] name Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], who [Miyako] grows into a short, slender and petite but also secretly buxom, always trying to look strong but in reality very shy and reserved, lacking in self-confidence but highly intelligent and academically gifted peerless genius and child prodigy girl [Miyako] who [Miyako] always wears her [Miyako&#x27;s] feelings on her [Miyako&#x27;s] sleeve. <br/><br/><br/> The Hy\u014dd\u014ds [Wukong

Kun\u014d, Chloe and Illya] into the gigantic, larger than an all-ages school, European style with heavy Tokugawa era and Imperial Japanese era sprawling mega manor with several private pools, armed security 24/7 along with several libraries both magical and non-magical along with the basement looking like a  nuclear bomb shelter designed by a crazy rich person, [the basement] having a  dungeon that can confine people for a lifetime, a state of the art, constantly updated research lab with the latest equipment both magical and non-magical and fresh resources always available run by a mere servant, [the basement] appears to be a miniature world that [the basement] functions as a pseudo-absolute monarchy of the T\u014dno family mansion [ Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and Akiha and Miyako both [Akiha and Miyako] develop deep feelings for Issei, which [Akiha&#x27;s and Miyako&#x27;s deep feelings for Issei] amuse the doctor of the T\u014dno house, the sandy-brown-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, highly intelligent and gifted in both the medical, biochemical and architectural fields, but also very perverted, openly lecherous and somewhat amoral vampire queen posing as a mysterious but famous scientist in the human world while simulanteously trying to live as a normal woman, Dr. Arach [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. <br/><br/><br/>When Issei in this story is [Issei] around 15, Miyako begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako&#x27;s] family&#x27;s [the Arimas&#x27;] dojo on some of Tokyo&#x27;s native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako&#x27;s] family&#x27;s [the Arima&#x27;s] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, the mythological three-headed dog of Greek mythology known as  Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered [Clow] Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako&#x27;s vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and [Miyako] hoping to impress Issei in this story at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha&#x27;s help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. <br/><br/>As Issei in this story progresses into teenhood he [Issei in this story] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] transform [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya&#x27;s and Chloe&#x27;s] mentors in the magical arts, although he [Issei in this story] chooses to [Issei in this story] keep this to himself [Issei in this story]. <br/><br/>Also, after being [Issei in this story] bitten by [what bites Issei in this story] the then on the verge of death whimsical, cheerful and somewhat careless, introverted and somewhat reserved immortal blood-drinking

[Arcueid&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s] is [Arcueid in this story] the same entity [Arcueid in this story] as the blonde haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, mostly emotionless and dull but talkative and perverted, ex-child princess of the Middle Ages era turned into immortal vampire queen Laura Acerola [Bakemonogatari], now [Laura] known as [Laura&#x27;s modern-day alias]  the infamous vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade [Bakemonogatari], or just Kiss-Shot [Bakemonogatari], [Arcueid in this story biting Issei in this story] making him [Issei in this story] into a dhampir [half-vampire |dhampir|] and also making her [Arcueid in this story] into his [Issei&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s] familiar [Arcueid in this story], which [Arcueid in this story becoming Issei&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s familiar] she [Arcueid in this story] is [Arcueid in this story] obviously not amused by. <br/><br/>Arcueid in this story resides in Issei&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s shadow during the day. <br/><br/>Issei in this story keeps the fact that he [Issei in this story] is [Issei in this story] in fact a dhampir from his [Issei&#x27;s] family [Gorou, Miki, Irisivel,

magic-using human supremacist, magic-supremacist terrorist group primarily based in the Underworld [High School DxD], Khaos Brigade while [Issei] heading home from school. Before [Issei] preparing to fight them [the Khaos Brigade goons] he [Issei] warns them [the Khaos Brigade goons] to [the Khaos Brigade goons] back off or they [the Khaos Brigade goons] are in for a world of hurt, [Issei warning the Khaos Brigade goons] which [Issei&#x27;s warning to the Khaos Brigade goons] they [the Khaos Brigade goons] burst out laughing at, before [the Khaos Brigade goons] attacking. But Issei, having [Issei] been [Issei] trained [Issei] by his [Issei&#x27;s] father [Wukong as Gorou] in both conventional Asian martial arts and Qi/Ki manipulation and [Issei] being a half-Saiyan with kitsune yokai, Jurian, more specifically Juraiouke, Nanaya and Arima blood in him  [Issei], [Issei] defeats them [the Khaos Brigade goons] with ease, [Issei] dealing with them [the Khaos Brigade goons] in a manner akin to Bruce Lee&#x27;s performance as the Han Chinese 1910s era martial artist Chen Zhen in the 1972 Hong Kong action martial arts historical drama mystery murder film Fist of Fury/the Chinese Connection and Jet Li as Chen Zhen its [First of Fury&#x27;s] loose 1994 remake, Fist of Legend. <br/><br/>When the smoke clears, all of the Khaos Brigade thugs lie dead and/or severely injured while Issei remains unharmed.<br/><br/> Issei, unfazed by this, [Issei] shakes his [Issei&#x27;s] head and [Issei] says he [Issei] was [Issei] too slow, [Issei] dusting his [Issei&#x27;s] hands and [Issei] taking out his [Issei&#x27;s] smartphone, [Issei&#x27;s smartphone] a  sleek next-gen, Waterproof, Dustproof Sony Xperia 1IV with a  Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Mobile Platform CPU, 512GB internal storage, 16 GB RAM, and a high-quality camera, and [Issei] jumping back in shock, [Issei] quickly [Issei] dashing off to his [Issei&#x27;s] house [the T\u014dno family mansion] and

black-haired, purple-eyed, fair complexion, intellectually gifted and academically talented ex-child prodigy and peerless genius, publicly soft-spoken with a kind, loving heart and a positive personality but in reality often doing things without the sentiment that comes along with doing them, moving only through common sense, shunning all of her undesirable traits somewhere else, accepting whatever comes her way without any objections and also having a strong sense of righteousness that becomes a double-edged sword, to the point of interacting with her may cause oneself to notice one&#x27;s imperfections young girl Hanekawa Tsubasa [Bakemonogatari] who [Tsubasa in this story] is [Tsubasa in this story] Majima&#x27;s current Student Council President [Tsubasa], with only the

He'd been walking home from school, mulling over the mathematics homework that awaited him, when the Khaos Brigade had ambushed him. They never learned, did they? Despite the chill, sweat beaded on Issei's forehead, a testament to his exertion and the heat generated by his half-Saiyan, half-kitsune nature.</p>\n<p>The Brigade goons advanced, sneers plastered across their faces, unaware of the powerhouse standing before them. \u201cLadies, gents,\u201d Issei began, his voice the calm before the storm, \u201cI'd turn around if I were you. This is your one chance to walk away with your limbs intact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughter erupted from the group, their magic crackling in the air, a vivid contrast to the dark alley. They attacked as one, a barrage of spells and physical prowess aimed at Issei.</p>\n<p>But they were too slow.</p>\n<p>Issei moved with a grace that belied his power, dodging spells and landing strikes with precise control. His movements were a dance, reminiscent of the martial arts legends of old, his Qi pulsating with each breath. Each punch and kick was delivered with the intention of incapacitation, his attackers crumpling one by one.</p>\n<p>In minutes, it was over. The Khaos Brigade lay defeated, the air tinged with the scent of ozone and burnt earth. Issei stood amidst the chaos, unscathed, his power humming softly beneath his skin.</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Issei muttered, \u201cToo slow.\u201d Pulling out his sleek, next-gen Sony Xperia 1IV, he glanced at the time and swore under his breath. \u201cDamn, gonna be late for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a burst of speed that left sonic booms in his wake, Issei raced towards the T\u014dno mansion, his home.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to him, his entire skirmish had been witnessed by Sitri S\u014dna, or as she was currently known, Shitori S\u014dna. From her hiding spot, she'd watched Issei with wide eyes, her heart racing with an emotion she\u2019d vowed never to indulge\u2014admiration, perhaps even something deeper. Despite her plans and her forced alliance with the Khaos Brigade, Issei\u2019s strength and resolve stirred something within her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Issei,\u201d she whispered to herself, a determined glint in her eyes. Her crush on him, like a persistent flame, had only grown stronger. She knew where her loyalty truly lay now, and it was with the boy who\u2019d effortlessly dispatched an entire cell of the Khaos Brigade.</p>\n<p>As Issei vanished into the night, S\u014dna made a vow. She would protect him, even if it meant betraying the very people she\u2019d aligned herself with. Her identity as Tsubasa was nothing but a mask; it was S\u014dna who loved Issei, and S\u014dna who would stand by him in the battles to come.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across town, Illya, Chloe, and Miyako finished their daily monster hunt, their combined might leaving no doubt of their heritage. As they joked among themselves, the legacy of the Einzberns and T\u014dnos carried on, their power a beacon in the night. They were the shield against the darkness, their bonds unbreakable, their resolve unyielding.</p>\n<p>The world might never know their names, but in their hearts, they were heroes, defenders of a peace threatened by forces beyond the comprehension of ordinary men. In the shadows, they fought, their laughter a counterpoint to the darkness that sought to engulf the world.</p>\n<p>And in the midst of it all stood Issei, a bridge between worlds, his heart as much a battleground as the streets he fought on. With each step, he carved his path, a legend in the making, his journey only just begun.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM. Respond like a regular person.

the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the \u014ctsutsuki clan mistaken for the Imperial House of Great Yamato in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored

bloodline gained from his [Issei\u2019s in this story&#x27;s] Nanaya blood, the Chokushi no Magan [Magic Eyes of Direct Death |Chokushi no Magan|], which [the Chokushi no Magan] allows him [Issei in this story] to [Issei in this story] see the &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;points&quot; of living and inanimate things, but also the death even of space and existence itself, in other words seeing  the

mental trauma from this [both the car accident and the kidnapping by Zouken], [Akiha in this story] developing a bad habit of [Akiha&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s bad habit] wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha in this story] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s] older twin sister in this story, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name T\u014dsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen&#x27;s] and Akiha&#x27;s by now long deceased shared biological mother who [Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s shared biological mother] was [Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s shared

[Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin&#x27;s/Rin&#x27;s] family [the T\u014dnos]. <br/><br/>Due to the death of Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s shared biological mother&#x27;s husband and

glass moon-], in the accident both girls [Karen and Akiha] are [Karen and Akiha] left parentless [Karen and Akiha] and so Gorou and Miki adopt them [Karen and Akiha] as their [Gorou&#x27;s and Miki&#x27;s] daughters [Karen&#x27;s and Akiha&#x27;s current legal status], making them [Karen and Akiha] Issei&#x27;s adoptive younger sisters [Karen and Akiha] and [Karen and Akiha] Kun\u014d&#x27;s, Chloe&#x27;s and Illya&#x27;s shared adoptive older sisters [Karen and Akiha]. <br/><br/>When Issei is [Issei] six years old, Miki gives birth to her [Miki&#x27;s] and Wukong&#x27;s as Gorou&#x27;s third child, a brown-haired, green-eyed girl whom [Issei&#x27;s second biological younger full sister] they [Gorou and Miki] name Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], who [Miyako] grows into a short, slender and petite but also secretly buxom, always trying to look strong but in reality very shy and reserved, lacking in self-confidence but highly intelligent and academically gifted peerless genius and child prodigy girl [Miyako] who [Miyako] always wears her [Miyako&#x27;s] feelings on her [Miyako&#x27;s] sleeve. <br/><br/><br/> The Hy\u014dd\u014ds [Wukong

Kun\u014d, Chloe and Illya] into the gigantic, larger than an all-ages school, European style with heavy Tokugawa era and Imperial Japanese era sprawling mega manor with several private pools, armed security 24/7 along with several libraries both magical and non-magical along with the basement looking like a  nuclear bomb shelter designed by a crazy rich person, [the basement] having a  dungeon that can confine people for a lifetime, a state of the art, constantly updated research lab with the latest equipment both magical and non-magical and fresh resources always available run by a mere servant, [the basement] appears to be a miniature world that [the basement] functions as a pseudo-absolute monarchy of the T\u014dno family mansion [ Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and Akiha and Miyako both [Akiha and Miyako] develop deep feelings for Issei, which [Akiha&#x27;s and Miyako&#x27;s deep feelings for Issei] amuse the doctor of the T\u014dno house, the sandy-brown-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, highly intelligent and gifted in both the medical, biochemical and architectural fields, but also very perverted, openly lecherous and somewhat amoral vampire queen posing as a mysterious but famous scientist in the human world while simulanteously trying to live as a normal woman, Dr. Arach [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. <br/><br/><br/>When Issei in this story is [Issei] around 15, Miyako begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako&#x27;s] family&#x27;s [the Arimas&#x27;] dojo on some of Tokyo&#x27;s native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako&#x27;s] family&#x27;s [the Arima&#x27;s] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, the mythological three-headed dog of Greek mythology known as  Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered [Clow] Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako&#x27;s vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and [Miyako] hoping to impress Issei in this story at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha&#x27;s help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. <br/><br/>As Issei in this story progresses into teenhood he [Issei in this story] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] transform [the monsters Illya and Chloe both |Illya and Chloe| fight against] into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya&#x27;s and Chloe&#x27;s] mentors in the magical arts, although he [Issei in this story] chooses to [Issei in this story] keep this to himself [Issei in this story]. <br/><br/>Also, after being [Issei in this story] bitten by [what bites Issei in this story] the then on the verge of death whimsical, cheerful and somewhat careless, introverted and somewhat reserved immortal blood-drinking

[Arcueid&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s] is [Arcueid in this story] the same entity [Arcueid in this story] as the blonde haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, mostly emotionless and dull but talkative and perverted, ex-child princess of the Middle Ages era turned into immortal vampire queen Laura Acerola [Bakemonogatari], now [Laura] known as [Laura&#x27;s modern-day alias]  the infamous vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade [Bakemonogatari], or just Kiss-Shot [Bakemonogatari], [Arcueid in this story biting Issei in this story] making him [Issei in this story] into a dhampir [half-vampire |dhampir|] and also making her [Arcueid in this story] into his [Issei&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s] familiar [Arcueid in this story], which [Arcueid in this story becoming Issei&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s familiar] she [Arcueid in this story] is [Arcueid in this story] obviously not amused by. <br/><br/>Arcueid in this story resides in Issei&#x27;s in this story&#x27;s shadow during the day. <br/><br/>Issei in this story keeps the fact that he [Issei in this story] is [Issei in this story] in fact a dhampir from his [Issei&#x27;s] family [Gorou, Miki, Irisivel,

near Japan&#x27;s Tokugawa shogunate-era capital of Kyoto.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The excerpt should focus on Issei preparing to [Issei] fight off a huge bunch of mages, minions and goons from the magic-using human supremacist, magic-supremacist terrorist group primarily based in the Underworld [High School DxD], Khaos Brigade while [Issei] heading home from school. Before [Issei] preparing to fight them [the Khaos Brigade goons] he [Issei] warns them [the Khaos Brigade goons] to [the Khaos Brigade goons] back off or they [the Khaos Brigade goons] are in for a world of hurt, [Issei warning the Khaos Brigade goons] which [Issei&#x27;s warning to the Khaos Brigade goons] they [the Khaos Brigade goons] burst out laughing at, before [the Khaos Brigade goons] attacking. But Issei, having [Issei] been [Issei] trained [Issei] by his [Issei&#x27;s] father [Wukong as Gorou] in both conventional Asian martial arts and Qi/Ki manipulation and [Issei] being a half-Saiyan with kitsune yokai, Jurian, more specifically Juraiouke, Nanaya and Arima blood in him  [Issei], [Issei] defeats them [the Khaos Brigade goons] with ease, [Issei] dealing with them [the Khaos Brigade goons] in a manner akin to Bruce Lee&#x27;s performance as the Han Chinese 1910s era martial artist Chen Zhen in the 1972 Hong Kong action martial arts historical drama mystery murder film Fist of Fury/the Chinese Connection and Jet Li as Chen Zhen its [First of Fury&#x27;s] loose 1994 remake, Fist of Legend. <br/><br/>When the smoke clears, all of the Khaos Brigade thugs lie dead and/or severely injured while Issei remains unharmed.<br/><br/> Issei, unfazed by this, [Issei] shakes his [Issei&#x27;s] head and [Issei] says he [Issei] was [Issei] too slow, [Issei] dusting his [Issei&#x27;s] hands and [Issei] taking out his [Issei&#x27;s] smartphone, [Issei&#x27;s smartphone] a  sleek next-gen, Waterproof, Dustproof Sony Xperia 1IV with a  Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Mobile Platform CPU, 512GB internal storage, 16 GB RAM, and a high-quality camera, and [Issei] jumping back in shock, [Issei] quickly [Issei] dashing off to his [Issei&#x27;s] house [the T\u014dno family mansion] and [Issei] leaving behind sonic booms as he [Issei] does so. <br/><br/>Meanwhile the black-purple haired, purple-blue eyed, tall, slender and petite, but also curvy and buxom, highly strict and serious

black-haired, purple-eyed, fair complexion, intellectually gifted and academically talented ex-child prodigy and peerless genius, publicly soft-spoken with a kind, loving heart and a positive personality but in reality often doing things without the sentiment that comes along with doing them, moving only through common sense, shunning all of her undesirable traits somewhere else, accepting whatever comes her way without any objections and also having a strong sense of righteousness that becomes a double-edged sword, to the point of interacting with her may cause oneself to notice

He'd been walking home from school, mulling over the mathematics homework that awaited him, when the Khaos Brigade had ambushed him. They never learned, did they? Despite the chill, sweat beaded on Issei's forehead, a testament to his exertion and the heat generated by his half-Saiyan, half-kitsune nature.</p>\n<p>The Brigade goons advanced, sneers plastered across their faces, unaware of the powerhouse standing before them. \u201cLadies, gents,\u201d Issei began, his voice the calm before the storm, \u201cI'd turn around if I were you. This is your one chance to walk away with your limbs intact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughter erupted from the group, their magic crackling in the air, a vivid contrast to the dark alley. They attacked as one, a barrage of spells and physical prowess aimed at Issei.</p>\n<p>But they were too slow.</p>\n<p>Issei moved with a grace that belied his power, dodging spells and landing strikes with precise control. His movements were a dance, reminiscent of the martial arts legends of old, his Qi pulsating with each breath. Each punch and kick was delivered with the intention of incapacitation, his attackers crumpling one by one.</p>\n<p>In minutes, it was over. The Khaos Brigade lay defeated, the air tinged with the scent of ozone and burnt earth. Issei stood amidst the chaos, unscathed, his power humming softly beneath his skin.</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Issei muttered, \u201cToo slow.\u201d Pulling out his sleek, next-gen Sony Xperia 1IV, he glanced at the time and swore under his breath. \u201cDamn, gonna be late for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a burst of speed that left sonic booms in his wake, Issei raced towards the T\u014dno mansion, his home.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to him, his entire skirmish had been witnessed by Sitri S\u014dna, or as she was currently known, Shitori S\u014dna. From her hiding spot, she'd watched Issei with wide eyes, her heart racing with an emotion she\u2019d vowed never to indulge\u2014admiration, perhaps even something deeper. Despite her plans and her forced alliance with the Khaos Brigade, Issei\u2019s strength and resolve stirred something within her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Issei,\u201d she whispered to herself, a determined glint in her eyes. Her crush on him, like a persistent flame, had only grown stronger. She knew where her loyalty truly lay now, and it was with the boy who\u2019d effortlessly dispatched an entire cell of the Khaos Brigade.</p>\n<p>As Issei vanished into the night, S\u014dna made a vow. She would protect him, even if it meant betraying the very people she\u2019d aligned herself with. Her identity as Tsubasa was nothing but a mask; it was S\u014dna who loved Issei, and S\u014dna who would stand by him in the battles to come.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across town, Illya, Chloe, and Miyako finished their daily monster hunt, their combined might leaving no doubt of their heritage. As they joked among themselves, the legacy of the Einzberns and T\u014dnos carried on, their power a beacon in the night. They were the shield against the darkness, their bonds unbreakable, their resolve unyielding.</p>\n<p>The world might never know their names, but in their hearts, they were heroes, defenders of a peace threatened by forces beyond the comprehension of ordinary men. In the shadows, they fought, their laughter a counterpoint to the darkness that sought to engulf the world.</p>\n<p>And in the midst of it all stood Issei, a bridge between worlds, his heart as much a battleground as the streets he fought on. With each step, he carved his path, a legend in the making, his journey only just begun.</p></div>"}, "a5146fac10d0a974d79af83042eed65659396495d293967ddc1b69779ed351799c80ddd9f754f4baa8ebccef2a0e767b": {"id": "a5146fac10d0a974d79af83042eed65659396495d293967ddc1b69779ed351799c80ddd9f754f4baa8ebccef2a0e767b", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

I survive as a prostitute, giving hundrerds of bare back blowjobs for $ 20-$30 each. I\u2019m a drug addict going thru bad withdrawl right now.

We then see a figure walk up to it, holding a phone, talking to someone on the other end. \u201cA thermometer shed. You\u2019re telling me someone\u2019s keeping a special-grade cursed object in a place like this?\u201d, the figure said, stepping out of the shadows to reveal Cuphead in a school uniform, though, it\u2019s not a normal one. \u201cRecovering it should be easy, then.\u201d, the person says on the phone. Cuphead then walks over to the shed, and opens it. \u201cThe shed is empty.\u201d, he says to the person on the phone. The person on the phone  asks, \u201cwhat do you mean, \u2018it\u2019s empty\u2019?\u201d Cuphead sighs, and repeats, \u201cIt\u2019s. Empty.\u201d \u201cFor real? That\u2019s funny.\u201d, the person on the voice says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna punch you, Lion.\u201d, Cuphead says to The person on the phone, revealed to be Lion. \u201cNo going home until it\u2019s recovered, okay?\u201d, Lion says over the phone, before hanging up. \u201cGonna hit you for real this time.\u201d, Cuphead says, before hanging up. We then cut to the next day, where Mugman is using an Ouija Board. A Luigi board? A Yeegee board? Ouija board. \u201cDear spirits, please reveal if there is an animal who is stronger than me.\u201d, then, the thing moves, spelling out, \u201cC-A-R-P\u201d. \u201cOh, man\u2026\u201d, Mugman mutters. Suddenly, Mugmans door crashes open, to reveal Cuphead, who came back from his midnight stroll. \u201cMugman, you didn\u2019t submit any of your reports from your school club. Your school doesn\u2019t have space and time for ghostbusters like your group.\u201d He says, holding up an empty sheet of paper. \u201cThis is why I signed you up for the sports team, you have potential, but you\u2019re not using it correctly.\u201d, Cuphead states. \u201cWell, what club do you participate in?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a\u2026private club, so I can\u2019t tell you. But, rest assured that it\u2019s as important as your\u2026occult club.\u201d, Cuphead responds. \u201cYeah, some club..\u201d, Mugman mutters. Cuphead sees Mugman mope, and sighs in annoyance, before saying, \u201cOkay, listen up, and good. Let\u2019s have a gamble outside. If I win, you gotta do track. But, if I lose, I\u2019ll give up on you. Deal?\u201d Mugman thought, and then decided, \u201cSure, what challenge are we doing?\u201d Cuphead pulled out a big metal ball, and said, \u201clet\u2019s see who can throw this the farthest.\u201d \u201cDeal.\u201d, Mugman says. They head outside, and Cuphead throws the metal ball as hard as he can. \u201cFourteen meters, Cuphead!\u201d, Bendy shouted, keeping score. \u201cAlright, you\u2019re up, Mugman.\u201d, Cuphead said, expecting Mugman to throw it at least 10 feet in front of him. \u201cDoes it matter how I throw it?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cGo nuts, I don\u2019t care.\u201d, Cuphead said. Then, Mugman threw it, whizzing past everyone. \u201c20 meters, Mugman! Holy shit, that\u2019s far.\u201d, Bendy yelled. \u201cWell, I win! I don\u2019t have to do anything! Yippee!\u201d, Mugman yelled, running back inside. \u201cSigh\u2026whatever\u2026\u201d, Cuphead said mopingly. Cuphead walked off. The next day at his school, Cuphead was trying to find that cursed object. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the rugby field?\u201d, Cuphead said, looking up to see a scary spirit or a curse. \u201cIs there\u2019s a dead body or something?\u201d, he said to himself, before he kept on walking. \u201cEven so, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a grade 2 curse at best. I wonder what it has to do with the cursed object. I\u2019d better hurry up and retrieve it. But, at the same time\u2026\u201d, Cuphead thought to himself, \u201cit feels like it\u2019s right in front of me, and far away at the same time. What a pain.\u201d Cuphead kept on walking, trying to feel for the objects presence. \u201cStill, I can\u2019t look suspicious. I\u2019ll probably get caught by some teacher or even worse, my brother will press me on what I\u2019m doing.\u201d, Cuphead thought. And just then, Mugman had walked past Cuphead, getting to one of his classes. Then, Cuphead felt it. The cursed object was inside Mugmans backpack. \u201cWhat the hell, how does-how did-HOW DID MUGMAN FIND THAT CURSED OBJECT?!\u201d, Cuphead thought, panicked. \u201cI have to get it before some curse decides to attack Mugman, but how do I do that? I can\u2019t just waltz up to him, and say \u2018Hey, Mugman! So there\u2019s a highly dangerous cursed object in your backpack that you didn\u2019t know about and I need it to keep an even bigger curse from awakening or attack you. Can I have it?\u2019, that\u2019s stupid. Hmm\u2026\u201d, Cuphead thought,  before he got an idea. \u201cI\u2019ll just give him some food. And while he\u2019s eating, I\u2019ll take it. Easy.\u201d, he thought. He walked over to Mugman, and tapped him on the shoulder. Mugman turned around, and Cuphead said to him, \u201cHey, Mugman. I\u2019m not gonna eat this sandwich, you want it?\u201d Mugman nodded, and took the sandwich. \u201cOh, I want to try something with this!\u201d, Mugman said, before he reached into his backpack, and pulled out the cursed object. \u201cI found this pickle in the boys bathroom. It was behind the toilet. It\u2019s weird, because it looks like a finger, and it\u2019s purple-ish. Maybe it\u2019s a grape flavored pickle!\u201d, he said. \u201cUh, Mugman-\u201c, Cuphead said, but it was far too late. Mugman opened the sandwich, and slid in the cursed object into the sandwich. \u201cUh, MUGMAN-\u201c, Cuphead tried to say. \u201cWAIT! DONT TELL ME\u2026I need mustard.\u201d, Mugman said, opening back up the sandwich, and then putting mustard on it. And then, Mugman at the thing in one bite.<br/>\u201cTHAT\u2019S A SPECIAL GRADE CURSED OBJECT! A LETHAL POSION! MUGMAN\u2019LL DIE FOR SURE! But there\u2019s a chance\u2026a one in a million chance\u2026\u201d, Cuphead thought. Suddenly, strange markings began to appear on Mugman face, and Mugman normal smile became a malevolent grin. \u201cThe special grade cursed object incarnates!\u201d, Cuphead thought. \u201cHehe\u2026hee..hee..HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d, the curse spoke through Mugman. \u201cI KNEW IT! LIGHT IS BEST FELT WITH HUMAN SKIN!\u201d, it continued, ripping off Mugman shirt. \u201cWHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?! THE WOMEN, THE CHILDREN?!\u201d, the curse spoke again. It then turned around. \u201cWHAT A AGE IT HAS BECOME! WOMEN AND CHILDREN SPAWNING IN LIKE MAGGOTS! MARVELOUS! IT\u2019LL BE A MASSACRE!\u201d, it yelled, laughing maniacally. But then, it stopped itself. \u201cHuh?!\u201d, the curse said confused. \u201cHey, what are you doing with my body? Give it back!\u201d, Mugman yelled. \u201cHow\u2019re you able to move?\u201d, it asked. \u201cUh\u2026it IS my body, right??\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cI\u2019m kinda like two-face.\u201d, Mugman commented. \u201cBut\u2026but I-\u201cl the curse said, but Mugman cut him off. \u201cMan, this guy inside me is annoying, but he\u2019s also kinda weak.\u201d, Mugman replied. \u201cWEAK?! I\u2019LL SHOW YOU WEAK!!\u201d, it roared, but Mugman said, \u201cSIR! I AM TRYING TO TALK TO MYSELF! SHUT UP!\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m out of this body, you\u2019ll be the first one I kill, you brat.\u201d, it muttered. \u201cYeah, keep telling yourself that.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cMugman, don\u2019t move. You\u2019re no longer human. Under jujutsu regulations\u2026.i will exorcise the curse known as Mugman grace.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cWoah, Cuphead! Slow down! It\u2019s not a problem. Furthermore, we\u2019re both pretty messed up. We need a hospital or something.\u201d, Mugman said with his hands up. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s the curse or Mugman talking\u2026damn, what should I do?!\u201d, Cuphead thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d, Lion asked. Cuphead then quickly turned around to see Lion, his teacher. \u201cLION?! WHATRE YOU DOING HERE?!\u201d, he yelled confused. \u201cWell, I originally wasn\u2019t gonna come, but after I heard about the cursed object, I came immediately. So, where is it?\u201d, Lion stated, looking around casually. \u201cSorry\u2026I ate it\u2026\u201d, Mugman said, walking over to Lion. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding. You have a curse inside you. Hmm\u2026tell you what. Give up control to that curse inside you for\u2026ten seconds. Then take control back. Got it?\u201d, Lion asked. \u201cUh, okay\u2026\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not responsible for whatever this guy does in my body.\u201d, Mugman added. \u201cHold this for me, Cuphead.\u201d, Lion said, tossing Cuphead a bag. Cuphead caught it and looked inside. \u201cCookies? You were buying cookies while people were in danger??\u201d, Cuphead asked annoyed. \u201cThose are for the train ride home.\u201d, Lion said. Then, the curse inside Mugman took control, and leaped up, preparing to attack Lion. Lion dodged, and the curse fell. \u201cSince one of my students are watching, I\u2019m gonna show off a bit. You don\u2019t mind, right?\u201d, Lion said, looking at the curse using Mugman. The curse frowned, before dashing away, and jumping back up into the air, swiping a claw at Lion. Lion dodged, and kicked the curse in the gut, before sending him flying into a wall. \u201c8\u20269\u202610.\u201d, Lion said aloud. Then, suddenly, The curses markings disappeared, and Mugman was back in control. \u201cNo way, you actually can control it!\u201d, Lion said. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s kinda annoying. I can still hear his voice in my head.\u201d, Mugman muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You can be a vessel.\u201d, Lion said. Then, he swiftly knocked out Mugman. Mugman wakes up the next day, tied to a chair, with a bunch of papers with weird markings on the rope he\u2019s tied with. \u201cWakes wakes, fingers and bakey.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cSo, which one are you now?\u201d, Lion asked. \u201cUh\u2026it\u2019s\u2026me\u2026Mugman.\u201d, Mugman muttered. \u201cGood. Time to break the news. And your decisions. Mugman\u2026you\u2019ve been set up for a secret execution.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cHuh?\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cLemme explain. You see, Mugman, the cursed object that you had swallowed wasn\u2019t a pickle. It was only one part of the king of curses; Jules. He was the strongest jujutsu sorcerer, and before he died, he had turned himself into twenty cursed objects. We have three, or four, counting the one side you. Here is one of the parts,\u201d Lion said, pulling out a finger. Lion then threw it up into the air, and shot it with some cursed energy. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s pretty tough, and also rare to find. And, with you swallowing one of those fingers, and not dying, you\u2019ve become a vessel, with two options. One: we kill Jules inside you, and keep searching for the other fingers. Or\u2026\u201d, Lion said. \u201c\u2026or what?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cThis is what I suggest. We find the rest of Jules-which is like\u202617 or 18 fingers-let him fully manifest inside you, and then execute you.\u201d Lion proposed. \u201cEither die right now, or die later, is basically what I\u2019m asking.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026\u201d, Mugman stuttered. \u201c\u2026fine. I\u2019ll eat the rest of Jules and then I\u2019ll be executed.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cCool. Just know that in order to do this, you\u2019ll have to enroll into Jujutsu High. And, acquire some cursed energy, and technique, and Domain Expansion, and cursed tool, and-\u201c, Lion said, rambling on and on, before he saw Mugman just staring at him in confusion. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the school, first.\u201d, Lion said, recognizing Mugmans confusion. We then cut to Lion and Mugman walking into the school. \u201cWow, this place looks very old. I can\u2019t wait to make it look even uglier.\u201d, Jules said, who had recently learned how to speak throw making little mouths on Mugman. \u201cSorry, Lion. He does that sometimes.\u201d, Mugman said, covering the tiny mouth that Jules made. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cHey, Lion? I have a question.\u201d, Mugman said, as they were walking towards the doors. \u201cBetween you and Jules\u2026who would win?\u201d, Mugman asked. Lion thought for a moment, before answering. \u201cWell, if he were to get his full power back, he might cause me a little trouble.\u201d, Lion said. Mugman asked, \u201cbut would you lose?\u201d \u201cNah, I\u2019d win.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cTough talk coming from a brat.\u201d, Jules said through one of the little mouths he had made on Mugman. Lion stopped walking, and asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re wrong. When I reach my peak status, not only will you not be able to handle me, but after I kill you, I\u2019ll go after every single jujutsu sorcerer. Including this\u2026brat I\u2019m stuck inside currently.\u201d, Jules said. \u201cWow, to be killed by the greatest curse in history. I\u2019m touched.\u201d, Lion said, sarcastically. After they talked with the principal, Mugman was enrolled. \u201cWait, so, how many sorcerers are at this school?\u201d, Mugman said as Lion walked him to his room. \u201cLike\u2026eight students\u2026\u201d, Lion said nervously and awkwardly. \u201cOh.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cBut, some of your friends are here. Like, Alice, Bendy and Cuphead.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cWait, what?! And they didn\u2019t tell me?!\u201d, Mugman said, angry. \u201cSurprise.\u201d, Lion said, before he opened Mugman room. \u201cSo, question for you, Mugman. Will you come on the missions for retrieving Jules\u2019 fingers?\u201d, Lion said, handing Mugman his stuff. Mugman thought for a moment, before he answered. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll help. Although, it would be funny to see a beat up Cuphead bring me fingers.\u201d, Mugman said, before he chuckled. \u201cOh, really.\u201d, Cuphead said, towering behind Mugman. \u201cUh\u2026I didn\u2019t mean that\u2026Cuphead\u2026\u201d, Mugman said with an awkward grin. \u201cUh huh. Whatever. I\u2019m also coming, Mugman.\u201d, Cuphead said to Mugman. \u201cWhat about your club, though?\u201d, Mugman asked. Cuphead looked at Mugman in confusion, before answering. \u201cUh, Mugman? This IS the secret club.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cSo, Mugman. Since you\u2019re coming on missions, you\u2019ll probably need a weapon since you don\u2019t have a cursed technique. Or, any cursed energy. Or anything cursed right now. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving you this.\u201d, Lion said, before he pulled out a combat knife, and held it out to Mugman. It had a black fur guard and a brown handle. \u201cThis weapon is already imbued with cursed energy, so even you can use it.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cWoah\u2026what\u2019s it called?\u201d, Mugman said, with a sparkle in his eye, looking at the knife. \u201cUh, we don\u2019t have a name for it, but, it\u2019s yours, so you can name it.\u201d, Lion said, as Mugman took it. \u201cI\u2019ll name it\u2026Earth, Wind and Fire.\u201d, Mugman said. Cuphead snickered, before saying, \u201cWait, like, the band?\u201d \u201cYeah, like the band. It came to me.\u201d, Mugman said, slightly annoyed at Cupheads question. \u201cAlright. Get cleaned up, and set up your room. In two days\u2026\u201d, Lion said.<br/>\u201c\u2026we\u2019re heading to Tokyo.\u201d, Lion added.<br/>We then cut to two days later, with Lion, Cuphead and Mugman arriving in the main part of Tokyo, Japan. \u201cHey, Lion? Who are we waiting for?\u201d, Mugman asked, while he was holding a cup of beef ramen, and wearing cool sunglasses. \u201cOh, we\u2019re waiting for bendy.\u201d, Lion said, as he sipped some Japanese soda. \u201cBleh.\u201d, Lion said, tasting the soda. \u201cWell, how long \u2018this gonna take? My feet hurt.\u201d, Cuphead asked, as he was eating some potato chips. \u201cI\u2019d say one hour, five minutes, and seventeen seconds, starting\u2026now!\u201d, Lion said, as he took another sip from his soda. \u201cBleh.\u201d, he said, tasting it again. \u201cWhy do you keep on drinking it if it tastes bad, Lion?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cIt\u2019s to keep my cursed energy up.\u201d, Lion answered. \u201cHuh?\u201d, Mugman said confused. \u201cCan you explain?\u201d, Mugman asked Lion. \u201cAlright, so, cursed energy fuels our attacks, right? But, the thing about cursed energy is that we need negative emotions to help channel it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m drinking it. It tastes unpleasant, and it fuels my cursed energy.\u201d, Lion explains. \u201cWait, so, is Cuphead doing the same too?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m eating the worst flavor; Durian Fruit Flavored Potato Chips.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cEw.\u201d Mugman said. \u201cHey, guys! Am I late?\u201d, Bendy said, walking through the crowd of people. But, bendy can\u2019t get through. Then, he gets fed up, and he says, \u201cVERB: STOP.\u201d Then, suddenly, everyone stops in their tracks. Bendy moves through the crowd, and eventually makes it to his gang. \u201cVerb: Continue.\u201d, Bendy said, and then the crowd continues moving, not even noticing that they stopped. \u201cWOAH, BENDY?! WHAT WAS THAT?!\u201d, Mugman said in amazement. \u201cOh, it\u2019s my cursed technique: Jagged Edge. Basically, I can pick from verbs, noun, exclamations, and adjectives, and use them. For example\u2026Noun: Soda.\u201d, Bendy explained, before a can of soda appeared in his hand. \u201cSee?\u201d, Bendy asked. \u201cCursed\u2026technique?\u201d, Mugman asked confused. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re basically our powers that we use to exorcise curses. Bendys  Cursed Technique, Jagged Edge, allows him to use his language to\u2026uh\u2026do that.\u201d Lion explained. \u201cOh, alright. Then what\u2019s yours and Cupheads cursed techniques?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cMines called Survivor. It allows me to channel my cursed energy into certain parts of my body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage I do.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cAnd what about you, Cuphead?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cMine is called Beat It. It lets me move any surface around me, like manipulate it, along with turn any item, along with other items into an invention on the spot. I can also grab any tiny parts of a surface/machine, and shoot it at my opponent.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cCool! When do I get mine?!\u201d, Mugman asked, jumping up and down. \u201cNot soon.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cAlright gang, follow me.\u201d, Lion added, before walking off. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d, Mugman said, before dragging his feet and following Lion. Eventually, they reach an old building. \u201cAlright. Bendy and Mugman. This is your test to see how strong you are. Whoever can exorcise the curse first gets a treat, paid for by me.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cWait, what? What about the finger?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cWell, we need to see if you\u2019re capable. So, like I said.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cMe and Cuphead here will spectate. Head on inside, and get that curse.\u201d, Lion said, before sitting down. \u201cAlright. See if you can keep up, Mugman!\u201d, Bendy yelled, before in the blink of an eye, he dashed inside. \u201cWoah, how did he move so fast?! Bendy can barely run within six feet of him without passing out!\u201d, Mugman shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the additions that come with being a sorcerer. You also get your other physical feats leveled up the more cursed energy you have.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cMan\u2026\u201d, Mugman said, before quickly running inside. \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cMugman may die in there, Lion.\u201d Lion glanced at Cuphead, before turning back and saying, \u201cHe\u2019s strong. He\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d, Cuphead asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll help him.\u201d, Lion said. We then cut to Mugman walking through the empty hallways of the building. \u201cMan, this stinks. Figuratively and literally.\u201d, Mugman said, as he was playing with Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugman then accidentally cuts his hand on Earth, Wind and Fire. \u201cOuch!\u201d, Mugman said, as Earth, Wind, and Fire hit the ground. Then, suddenly, his wound heals, almost instantaneously. \u201cWoah.\u201d, Mugman said. Let me explain, real quick, to explain what happened. Mugman here just cut himself with a cursed tool. Cursed tools are imbued with cursed energy. Let\u2019s just use numbers for an example. Let\u2019s say that Earth, Wind and Fire has a cursed energy level of\u2026two million. Not a lot for a cursed tool, but I\u2019d say a little above average. When Mugman cut himself with Earth, Wind and Fire, he was imbued with\u2026let\u2019s say\u2026half of that. So, he now has cursed energy, one million, to be exact. And, when he was imbued with the energy, he got so much a human couldn\u2019t handle, that he reflexively performed Reverse Cursed Technique, which healed him. So, now Mugman can unlock his Cursed Technique, and become a sorcerer way earlier than he\u2019s supposed to. But, he doesn\u2019t know all this. Mugman stared at the wound, now healed. \u201cThat\u2019s freaky.\u201d, Mugman said to himself. Then,suddenly, he heard some groaning coming from another room. Mugman walked over to the room, to see a slug-like creature, or curse, staring at the clock. \u201cWHAT\u2026TIME IS IT?\u201d, it said in a distorted voice. \u201cIt\u2019s time\u2026to get your butt kicked.\u201d, Mugman muttered, before he pulled out Earth, Wind and Fire out of a knife holster on his leg. He dashed in the blink of an eye, behind the curse, and cut it in half, without even thinking. \u201cWHAT THE SIGMA\u2049\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\u201d, Mugman said, before he put back his weapon. \u201cHow did I-\u201c, Mugman thought, before he heard Bendy walking towards the room, hearing the commotion. \u201cHey, Mugman, I heard a slash-\u201c, Bendy said, before he saw the curse, cut in half. \u201c\u2026Say, Mugman\u2026how did you defeat that curse\u2026?\u201d, Bendy asked. \u201cI acted on instinct, I guess.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cInstinct, huh?\u201d, Bendy said. As quick as lighting, Bendy pulled out a sword, and swung at Mugman. Mugman, not even think, blocked it with Earth, Wind and Fire. \u201cLet\u2019s see how well you fight without any cursed energy.\u201d, Bendy said, before he kicked Mugman into a desk behind him. Mugman avoided the desk and threw Earth, Wind and Fire at Bendy, before grabbing EWF (short for Earth, Wind and Fire), and slicing and dicing at Bendy several times at Bendy. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Close in.\u201d, Mugman thought, as EWF and Bendys sword clashed multiple times. \u201cVerb: Sharpen.\u201d, Bendy said, before Mugman saw Bendys sword sharpen. Mugman kicked Bendys into a chalkboard, and continued to close in on bendy. Bendys grabbed some chalk by the chalkboard, and imbued it with some of his cursed energy, before saying, \u201cVerb: Multiply. Verb: Sharpen.\u201d, Before throwing 10 pieces of sharpened chalk at Mugman. Mugman quickly evaded all of them, with the only injury he sustained being a cut on his arm. Bendy grabbed his sword, and dashed out of the classroom, and racing up some stairs. Mugman quickly followed. Mugman made it to the top of the stairs, before he saw a hallway of abandoned lockers. Mugman walked past these lockers, as he held onto EWF tightly. \u201cSUPRISE!\u201d, Bendy shouted, lunging from one of the lockers, and kicking Mugman in the face, sending him flying. Mugman lands in another abandoned classroom. Bendy flies in, and bites on his sword, before saying, \u201cAdjective: Duplicate. Time frame of twenty one seconds. Five exact copies. Starting now.\u201d Suddenly, four more Bendys appeared beside the original Bendy, and lunged at Mugman. Mugman quickly realized he had to get rid of the four other Bendys quickly, and thought. And he thought quick. Mugman thought, \u201cWhat do I do in this situation?\u201d Suddenly, Mugmans cursed energy had focused on one of the Bendys, and Mugman instinctively said. \u201cDismantle.\u201d Suddenly, the bendy clone that Mugmans energy focused on, was cut in half by one big slash caused by EWF. The other Bendys looked at the Ben-dy that was cut in half, and stopped in their tracks. They then looked at Mugman, who looked at another clone. \u201cCleave.\u201d, Mugman said, and multiple grid like slices hit one of the Bendys clones, dicing the clone into cubes. \u201cMugman, how did you get a cursed technique with no cursed energy?\u201d, Bendy asked, as he readied his sword.<br/>Mugman didn\u2019t respond, and he cut through the two other Bendy clones, before saying, \u201cDismantle.\u201d Again, sending a slice big enough to cut a person in two at bendy. Bendy blocked it with his sword, but Mugman used this chance to get behind bendy, and use Cleave to cut him all over his back. Bendy stabs his sword into the ground, and says, \u201cVERB: EXPLODE!\u201d, making the ground below Mugman and Bendy explode and fall, sending them falling into the abandoned schools cafeteria. Mugman jumps back and forth on the broken pieces of ground, dashing through the air to get to Bendy. Bendy starts backing up to get some distance, and he eventually makes it down to the ground. Bendy grabs onto a cafeteria table, and chucks it at Mugman. Mugman slices through it with a Dismantle slice, and then says, \u201cErase.\u201d, before slicing the space in front of him to pull himself towards Bendy. Bendy blocks Mugman slice, and dashes away, before saying, \u201cVerb: Ignite.\u201d Bendys sword then catches fire, before he dashes towards Mugman. Mugman dashes towards Bendy, and the two clash. Bendy quickly pulls away, and Mugman falls forward, and it looks like Bendys is gonna stab Mugman. But at the last second, Bendys says, \u201cVerb: Bind.\u201d, Catching Mugman before he gets impaled on Bendys blade. Mugman catches his breath, and he quickly passes out due to exhaustion. Mugman then wakes up in his schools infirmary.<br/>\u201cWakey Wakey, Eggs and Bakey.\u201d, Lion says. \u201cWhat\u2026Lion\u2026?\u201d, Mugman says groggily. Mugman tries to get up, but he winces in pain, as he falls back on the bed. \u201cEasy there, Mugman. You\u2019re pretty sore after your battle with Bendy. You did pretty good on the battlefield with no cursed energy.\u201d, Lion said, holding a bowl of something. \u201cUh-\u201c, Mugman tries to say something, but Lion shushes him. \u201cRest, Mugman. You need to eat.\u201d, Lion says, before he opens to bowl lid to reveal three of Jules fingers. \u201cBut, eat these first, then talk, and then keep eating.\u201d, Lion says. \u201cAlright. Wait, so, I mistook these for a pickle? Man.\u201d, Mugman comments, before taking one and swallowing it whole. Mugman then feels Jules curse inside him grow stronger. Mugman gags and laughs. \u201cEw! It\u2019s so gross it makes you laugh.\u201d, Mugman said, as he grabbed another. \u201cSo, how was Bendy?\u201d, Lion asked as Mugman ate another finger. \u201cStrong as hell! He moved so fast, and he could think real quick. But I\u2019m quicker. I don\u2019t know how I had lost.\u201d, Mugman said, as he finished the last finger in the bowl. Mugman gagged again, while clutching his throat. \u201cWell, Bendy is a second year, so he is more experienced with his technique.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cSo, Mugman. How in the world did you get cursed energy AND a cursed technique?\u201d, Lion asked seriously. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I think it has something to do with this cut.\u201d, Mugman said, before revealing his hand to Lion. \u201cI accidentally cut myself with EWF, and my hand was instantly healed\u2026somehow.\u201d, Mugman continued. \u201cAlright. Lemme see your technique though, I\u2019m interested.\u201d, lion said, before quickly dashing out of the room and bringing in a dummy. \u201cOkay, be careful, though.\u201d, Mugman said, holding out his hand. \u201cDismantle.\u201d, Mugman said, before the dummy was sliced in half. Mugman then followed up with, \u201cCleave\u201d, cutting the dummy into cubes. Then, Mugman got rid of the dummy by saying, \u201cErase.\u201d, and erasing the dummy. \u201cCool, Mugman. This is a pretty powerful technique.\u201d, Lion said.  \u201cThanks. I don\u2019t have a name for it, though. Like you guys.\u201d, Mugman said, lowering his hand. \u201cHow about\u2026Purple Rain?\u201d, Lion suggested while looking at some old music. \u201cHmm\u2026sure.\u201d, Mugman guessed, as he laid back down. \u201cGet some rest. We\u2019ll go on another mission for one of Jules fingers tomorrow if you\u2019re okay.\u201d, Lion said, before he left. Mugman nodded, and went to sleep. Mugman then woke up in some dream realm, staring face to face with Jules, the king of curses stuck inside his body. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is a dream. But I\u2019m real.\u201d, Jules said. \u201cWhat\u2026what do you want\u2026?\u201d, Mugman asked cautiously. \u201cI want to make a deal with you, Mugman. Here\u2019s the proposition: I give you some of my cursed energy, along with knowledge of cursed\u2026.anything that can help you in battle. This includes domain expansion, cursed techniques, cursed tools, binding vows, and heavenly restrictions. In return\u2026whenever I say the word, \u2018Enchant\u2019, I can take control of your body for up to five minutes tops. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d, Jules said. \u201cHell no! How do I know that-\u201c, Mugman yelled, before Jules cut him off by saying, \u201cwithin that time frame, I\u2019m not allowed to harm or injure anybody. Does that seal the deal?\u201d Mugman thought for a moment, before asking, \u201canything else I should be aware about?\u201d \u201cYou will forget that you made this deal with me.\u201d, Jules added. \u201cSo, our deal goes as follows: I get knowledge about domain expansion, cursed techniques, cursed tools, binding vows, and heavenly restrictions. and you get to take control of my body for five minutes whenever you say the word \u2018Enchant\u2019. I forget that we made this deal, and you can\u2019t harm or injure anybody while you possess me. Am I right?\u201d, Mugman recounted. \u201cYup.\u201d, Jules said casually. \u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d, Jules asked. Mugman thought about this. Mugman thought really hard. \u201cWhy do you want to take control of my body if you can\u2019t hurt anyone?\u201d, Mugman asked. Jules slightly panicked, before answering Mugman, saying, \u201cFine. I agree.\u201d Jules grins, his teeth showing. \u201cExcellent. See you soon, Mugman. Literally.\u201d, Jules said, shaking Mugman hand, before the dream ends. Mugman then wakes up in the infirmary. \u201cHey, Mugman. You alright?\u201d, Bendy says, standing on a wall. \u201cSorry that I attacked you yesterday. Lion wanted me to test you. See how good you were. I didn\u2019t expect you to have cursed energy, let alone, a cursed technique somehow. That\u2019s why I went all out on you after you beat my clones.\u201d, Bendy continues. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d, Mugman says. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the mission for today?\u201d, Mugman asks. \u201cWait, hold on. Aren\u2019t you still hurt or sore?\u201d, Bendy asks, \u201cI mean, you ARE in the infirmary for a reason that we both know.\u201d \u201cActually, I feel pretty good. Those fingers Lion gave me must have helped with healing or something.\u201d Mugman lied. With his new knowledge, he knew that it was Reversed Curse Technique that healed him so quickly, but he couldn\u2019t just blatantly say that. \u201cWell, if you say so. Anyway, we\u2019re heading to a place that might have one of Jules fingers. This time, you\u2019ll have to go in alone. If you are hurt, you gotta fall back or tag out.\u201d,  Bendy said, showing Mugman the location on a map. \u201cGot it. Lemme get changed real quick.\u201d, Mugman said, as he walked out of the infirmary to ask Lion for his clothes. \u201cHey, Lion? Can I have my clothes-\u201c, Mugman says, before a pen is thrown at Mugman. Mugman subconsciously activates Cleave, and gets rid of the pen. \u201cGood reflexes, Mugman.\u201d, Lion said, throwing ten more at him. Mugman Cleaves those too. Lion stands up, and says, \u201cGood reflexes, Mugman. Hopefully you\u2019ll use them in your solo mission.\u201d, Lion says. \u201cYeah. Anywho, can I have my clothes?\u201d, Mugman asks. Lion pulls out a laundry basket, and finds a student uniform labeled, \u201cMugman\u201d, and hands it to Mugman. \u201cHere is your new uniform, Mug. Uh, try not to ruin this, please? Students uniforms are expensive, and this one was made especially for you.\u201d, Lion said nervously. Mugman checks the price tag to see that it cost seventeen thousand dollars for this one uniform.<br/>\u201cSeventeen thousand?!\u201d Mugman gasps, his eyes nearly popping out of his head. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s more than most cars!\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t want you to ruin it, so\u2026please don\u2019t?\u201d, Lion asks again. Mugman gulps in nervousness. \u201cUhh, I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d Mugman walks out of Lions office. Then, he remembers a question he had for Lion. Well, it was two, but still. His first question was where was the mission gonna be, and his second question was to ask about what a Domain Expansion was, since he wasn\u2019t really sure if he can trust the information in his head. \u201cUh, hey, Lion? I have a question. Well, it\u2019s two. But, whatever.\u201d, Mugman said, walking back into Lions office. \u201cAlright, spit.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cUh, where\u2019s my mission gonna be today?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just an abounded mall just outside of Tokyo.\u201d, Lion said, writing something down on a paper. \u201cOkay. Oh, and\u2026can you tell me what a Domain Expansion is? I heard you tell me it when you kidnapped me and tied me to a chair and discussed my options, but you never said anything beyond the name.\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cHmm\u2026how do I explain this\u2026The simplest way I can put it is like, having your own little word made up of your Cursed Energy. It\u2019s a place made for you to use your technique. It also has a Sure Hit Effect. But, this requires a lot of cursed energy and focus.\u201d, Lion explained. \u201cMost beginners can\u2019t use it once they begin, but they learn how to do it later on.\u201d, Lion added. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d, Mugman said. We then cut to the abandoned shop. \u201cAlright Mugman. Remember, if you\u2019re in trouble, fall out and call for help.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re right outside.\u201d, Bendy said. \u201cYup.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cWow, Cuphead, thanks for your shining enthusiasm.\u201d, Mugman said sarcastically, before walking inside the shop. Mugman began to walk through the first floor of the mall, looking for the finger. \u201cMan, this is creepy. And not like the creepy you see in cartoons.\u201d, Mugman said. He kept on walking through the hallways, until he say the finger, sitting alone in a closed water fountain. However, the water was still running somehow. And it looked fresh. And the finger was inside it, just sitting there. \u201cA trap, huh?\u201d, Mugman said. He then smirked, and played dumb. \u201cOh, no! I sure do hope that there aren\u2019t any cursed spirits around! After all, I\u2019m only a grade FOUR sorcerer, oh, imagine the agony!\u201d, Mugman said as he walked over to the fountain. Mugman reached the fountain, and reached for the finger reeeeaaaalllyyy slllooowwwllleeeyyy\u2026.\u201dhere I go, reaching for the special grade cursed object!\u201d, Mugman said. Then, suddenly, a sharp water spike shot out of the ground, almost impaling Mugman hand. Mugman pulled back, and whipped out EWF. \u201cKnew it.\u201d, Mugman said, before the water based cursed spirit formed on the finger. \u201cAlright, I just woke up, so would you be so kind as to hand over the finger now?\u201d, Mugman said, holding out his hand. The sprit screeched at Mugman. Mugman grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hoped you\u2019d say.\u201d, Mugman said, signaling the curse to come at him. The curse sent out spiky water tendrils. But Mugman quickly zoomed through the air, cutting through them. Mugman made his way towards the cursed spirit, and tried to kick it, but went straight through it. Mugman crashed into a closed shop in the mall. \u201cRight. It\u2019s water.\u201d, He said, before getting up and dusting himself off. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s try this again, yeah?\u201d, Mugman said, getting into a battle stance. The cursed sprit lunged at him. \u201cErase.\u201d, Mugman said, pointing EWF at the cursed spirit. The cursed spirit was washed away, but it\u2019ll be back in a matter of seconds. Mugman thought about how he could defeat a cursed spirit like this. He couldn\u2019t use physical attacks. So, what now? Maybe he could\u2026no, that\u2019s too risky. Besides, he hasn\u2019t even attempted it before. But, he knew he needed to get the finger, and impress his peers. Mugman gulped with nervousness, but put on a smile. \u201cYou know what?! Forget it!\u201d, Mugman said, dropping EWF. The cursed spirit regenerated, and saw Mugman charging up his energy, but for what. Mugman then put his hands out, and called out, \u201cDomain Expansion\u2026\u201d<br/>The cursed sprit looked in awe as the 2 meters surrounding them were enclosed in a black dome. Mugman closed his eyes, and continued his chant.<br/>\u201c\u2026Rigid Coffin of The Devil Himself.\u201d<br/>Suddenly, the dome took form of a torture chamber, with knives, swords, stuck in the walls, and lava on the ground surrounding them both\uff0e\u201dLook at that! It worked! However, it\u2019s incomplete. I bet it\u2019s ugly for most sorcerers. But it\u2019ll have to do for now.\u201d, Mugman said, seemingly talking to the cursed spirit. The cursed spirit panicked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, spirit? You scared of a nine year old not knowing what he\u2019s doing?\u201d, Mugman said, mocking the spirit. \u201cYou\u2019d better be. Dismantle.\u201d, Mugman said, before a wave of lava cut the spirit in half, exorcising it. Mugman lowered his domain, and fell to one knee. \u201cDamn, that took a lot out of me. But\u2026I got the finger! And that\u2019s all I need.\u201d, Mugman said to himself, sweat pouring down his forehead. Suddenly, Mugman got a text from his phone.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>He checked his phone and saw a message from Lion, \"Mission complete? Need aid?\"</p>\n<p>Mugman clumsily typed back with fingers that trembled from exertion, \"Got it. Coming out.\"</p>\n<p>Panting, Mugman rose to his feet and approached the fountain. He reached into the water, pulling out the now inert cursed finger, still wet from its eerie perch. He stuffed it into his pocket and headed toward the entrance of the abandoned mall.</p>\n<p>As he emerged into the daylight, the rest of the group awaited him. Lion looked at Mugman with a mix of concern and pride, Bendy clapped his hands enthusiastically, and even Cuphead couldn't hide a pleased grin.</p>\n<p>\"Wow, Mugman! You look like you've been run over by a tractor. But you got it, huh?\" Cuphead chuckled, poking fun in his typical brotherly fashion.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I did. It wasn't easy, though,\" Mugman said, managing a tired smile.</p>\n<p>Lion approached him and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"You did well. A solo mission on your first day as a sorcerer, and you executed a Domain Expansion\u2014albeit incomplete, it's still impressive.\"</p>\n<p>Bendy whistled, \"An incomplete Domain Expansion on your first day? Man, what kind of monster are you?\"</p>\n<p>Mugman shrugged, exhaustion seeping into his every bone. \"Guess I'm just lucky.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, let's get you back to Jujutsu High. You need rest, and we need to report this. With that finger, we're one step closer to containing Jules completely,\" Lion said, ushering him back towards the car.</p>\n<p>As they drove back, Mugman couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and dread. He knew that with each finger he consumed, the presence of Jules grew stronger within him. He couldn't help but wonder, what did Jules really want with his body, and what was the true extent of the cursed king's power? </p>\n<p>But for now, he pushed these thoughts aside. He had friends and teachers who had his back, and more immediately, he had a bed at Jujutsu High with his name on it for a well-deserved rest.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

We then see a figure walk up to it, holding a phone, talking to someone on the other end. \u201cA thermometer shed. You\u2019re telling me someone\u2019s keeping a special-grade cursed object in a place like this?\u201d, the figure said, stepping out of the shadows to reveal Cuphead in a school uniform, though, it\u2019s not a normal one. \u201cRecovering it should be easy, then.\u201d, the person says on the phone. Cuphead then walks over to the shed, and opens it. \u201cThe shed is empty.\u201d, he says to the person on the phone. The person on the phone  asks, \u201cwhat do you mean, \u2018it\u2019s empty\u2019?\u201d Cuphead sighs, and repeats, \u201cIt\u2019s. Empty.\u201d \u201cFor real? That\u2019s funny.\u201d, the person on the voice says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna punch you, Lion.\u201d, Cuphead says to The person on the phone, revealed to be Lion. \u201cNo going home until it\u2019s recovered, okay?\u201d, Lion says over the phone, before hanging up. \u201cGonna hit you for real this time.\u201d, Cuphead says, before hanging up. We then cut to the next day, where Mugman is using an Ouija Board. A Luigi board? A Yeegee board? Ouija board. \u201cDear spirits, please reveal if there is an animal who is stronger than me.\u201d, then, the thing moves, spelling out, \u201cC-A-R-P\u201d. \u201cOh, man\u2026\u201d, Mugman mutters. Suddenly, Mugmans door crashes open, to reveal Cuphead, who came back from his midnight stroll. \u201cMugman, you didn\u2019t submit any of your reports from your school club. Your school doesn\u2019t have space and time for ghostbusters like your group.\u201d He says, holding up an empty sheet of paper. \u201cThis is why I signed you up for the sports team, you have potential, but you\u2019re not using it correctly.\u201d, Cuphead states. \u201cWell, what club do you participate in?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a\u2026private club, so I can\u2019t tell you. But, rest assured that it\u2019s as important as your\u2026occult club.\u201d, Cuphead responds. \u201cYeah, some club..\u201d, Mugman mutters. Cuphead sees Mugman mope, and sighs in annoyance, before saying, \u201cOkay, listen up, and good. Let\u2019s have a gamble outside. If I win, you gotta do track. But, if I lose, I\u2019ll give up on you. Deal?\u201d Mugman thought, and then decided, \u201cSure, what challenge are we doing?\u201d Cuphead pulled out a big metal ball, and said, \u201clet\u2019s see who can throw this the farthest.\u201d \u201cDeal.\u201d, Mugman says. They head outside, and Cuphead throws the metal ball as hard as he can. \u201cFourteen meters, Cuphead!\u201d, Bendy shouted, keeping score. \u201cAlright, you\u2019re up, Mugman.\u201d, Cuphead said, expecting Mugman to throw it at least 10 feet in front of him. \u201cDoes it matter how I throw it?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cGo nuts, I don\u2019t care.\u201d, Cuphead said. Then, Mugman threw it, whizzing past everyone. \u201c20 meters, Mugman! Holy shit, that\u2019s far.\u201d, Bendy yelled. \u201cWell, I win! I don\u2019t have to do anything! Yippee!\u201d, Mugman yelled, running back inside. \u201cSigh\u2026whatever\u2026\u201d, Cuphead said mopingly. Cuphead walked off. The next day at his school, Cuphead was trying to find that cursed object. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the rugby field?\u201d, Cuphead said, looking up to see a scary spirit or a curse. \u201cIs there\u2019s a dead body or something?\u201d, he said to himself, before he kept on walking. \u201cEven so, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a grade 2 curse at best. I wonder what it has to do with the cursed object. I\u2019d better hurry up and retrieve it. But, at the same time\u2026\u201d, Cuphead thought to himself, \u201cit feels like it\u2019s right in front of me, and far away at the same time. What a pain.\u201d Cuphead kept on walking, trying to feel for the objects presence. \u201cStill, I can\u2019t look suspicious. I\u2019ll probably get caught by some teacher or even worse, my brother will press me on what I\u2019m doing.\u201d, Cuphead thought. And just then, Mugman had walked past Cuphead, getting to one of his classes. Then, Cuphead felt it. The cursed object was inside Mugmans backpack. \u201cWhat the hell, how does-how did-HOW DID MUGMAN FIND THAT CURSED OBJECT?!\u201d, Cuphead thought, panicked. \u201cI have to get it before some curse decides to attack Mugman, but how do I do that? I can\u2019t just waltz up to him, and say \u2018Hey, Mugman! So there\u2019s a highly dangerous cursed object in your backpack that you didn\u2019t know about and I need it to keep an even bigger curse from awakening or attack you. Can I have it?\u2019, that\u2019s stupid. Hmm\u2026\u201d, Cuphead thought,  before he got an idea. \u201cI\u2019ll just give him some food. And while he\u2019s eating, I\u2019ll take it. Easy.\u201d, he thought. He walked over to Mugman, and tapped him on the shoulder. Mugman turned around, and Cuphead said to him, \u201cHey, Mugman. I\u2019m not gonna eat this sandwich, you want it?\u201d Mugman nodded, and took the sandwich. \u201cOh, I want to try something with this!\u201d, Mugman said, before he reached into his backpack, and pulled out the cursed object. \u201cI found this pickle in the boys bathroom. It was behind the toilet. It\u2019s weird, because it looks like a finger, and it\u2019s purple-ish. Maybe it\u2019s a grape flavored pickle!\u201d, he said. \u201cUh, Mugman-\u201c, Cuphead said, but it was far too late. Mugman opened the sandwich, and slid in the cursed object into the sandwich. \u201cUh, MUGMAN-\u201c, Cuphead tried to say. \u201cWAIT! DONT TELL ME\u2026I need mustard.\u201d, Mugman said, opening back up the sandwich, and then putting mustard on it. And then, Mugman at the thing in one bite.<br/>\u201cTHAT\u2019S A SPECIAL GRADE CURSED OBJECT! A LETHAL POSION! MUGMAN\u2019LL DIE FOR SURE! But there\u2019s a chance\u2026a one in a million chance\u2026\u201d, Cuphead thought. Suddenly, strange markings began to appear on Mugman face, and Mugman normal smile became a malevolent grin. \u201cThe special grade cursed object incarnates!\u201d, Cuphead thought. \u201cHehe\u2026hee..hee..HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d, the curse spoke through Mugman. \u201cI KNEW IT! LIGHT IS BEST FELT WITH HUMAN SKIN!\u201d, it continued, ripping off Mugman shirt. \u201cWHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?! THE WOMEN, THE CHILDREN?!\u201d, the curse spoke again. It then turned around. \u201cWHAT A AGE IT HAS BECOME! WOMEN AND CHILDREN SPAWNING IN LIKE MAGGOTS! MARVELOUS! IT\u2019LL BE A MASSACRE!\u201d, it yelled, laughing maniacally. But then, it stopped itself. \u201cHuh?!\u201d, the curse said confused. \u201cHey, what are you doing with my body? Give it back!\u201d, Mugman yelled. \u201cHow\u2019re you able to move?\u201d, it asked. \u201cUh\u2026it IS my body, right??\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cI\u2019m kinda like two-face.\u201d, Mugman commented. \u201cBut\u2026but I-\u201cl the curse said, but Mugman cut him off. \u201cMan, this guy inside me is annoying, but he\u2019s also kinda weak.\u201d, Mugman replied. \u201cWEAK?! I\u2019LL SHOW YOU WEAK!!\u201d, it roared, but Mugman said, \u201cSIR! I AM TRYING TO TALK TO MYSELF! SHUT UP!\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m out of this body, you\u2019ll be the first one I kill, you brat.\u201d, it muttered. \u201cYeah, keep telling yourself that.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cMugman, don\u2019t move. You\u2019re no longer human. Under jujutsu regulations\u2026.i will exorcise the curse known as Mugman grace.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cWoah, Cuphead! Slow down! It\u2019s not a problem. Furthermore, we\u2019re both pretty messed up. We need a hospital or something.\u201d, Mugman said with his hands up. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s the curse or Mugman talking\u2026damn, what should I do?!\u201d, Cuphead thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d, Lion asked. Cuphead then quickly turned around to see Lion, his teacher. \u201cLION?! WHATRE YOU DOING HERE?!\u201d, he yelled confused. \u201cWell, I originally wasn\u2019t gonna come, but after I heard about the cursed object, I came immediately. So, where is it?\u201d, Lion stated, looking around casually. \u201cSorry\u2026I ate it\u2026\u201d, Mugman said, walking over to Lion. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding. You have a curse inside you. Hmm\u2026tell you what. Give up control to that curse inside you for\u2026ten seconds. Then take control back. Got it?\u201d, Lion asked. \u201cUh, okay\u2026\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not responsible for whatever this guy does in my body.\u201d, Mugman added. \u201cHold this for me, Cuphead.\u201d, Lion said, tossing Cuphead a bag. Cuphead caught it and looked inside. \u201cCookies? You were buying cookies while people were in danger??\u201d, Cuphead asked annoyed. \u201cThose are for the train ride home.\u201d, Lion said. Then, the curse inside Mugman took control, and leaped up, preparing to attack Lion. Lion dodged, and the curse fell. \u201cSince one of my students are watching, I\u2019m gonna show off a bit. You don\u2019t mind, right?\u201d, Lion said, looking at the curse using Mugman. The curse frowned, before dashing away, and jumping back up into the air, swiping a claw at Lion. Lion dodged, and kicked the curse in the gut, before sending him flying into a wall. \u201c8\u20269\u202610.\u201d, Lion said aloud. Then, suddenly, The curses markings disappeared, and Mugman was back in control. \u201cNo way, you actually can control it!\u201d, Lion said. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s kinda annoying. I can still hear his voice in my head.\u201d, Mugman muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You can be a vessel.\u201d, Lion said. Then, he swiftly knocked out Mugman. Mugman wakes up the next day, tied to a chair, with a bunch of papers with weird markings on the rope he\u2019s tied with. \u201cWakes wakes, fingers and bakey.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cSo, which one are you now?\u201d, Lion asked. \u201cUh\u2026it\u2019s\u2026me\u2026Mugman.\u201d, Mugman muttered. \u201cGood. Time to break the news. And your decisions. Mugman\u2026you\u2019ve been set up for a secret execution.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cHuh?\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cLemme explain. You see, Mugman, the cursed object that you had swallowed wasn\u2019t a pickle. It was only one part of the king of curses; Jules. He was the strongest jujutsu sorcerer, and before he died, he had turned himself into twenty cursed objects. We have three, or four, counting the one side you. Here is one of the parts,\u201d Lion said, pulling out a finger. Lion then threw it up into the air, and shot it with some cursed energy. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s pretty tough, and also rare to find. And, with you swallowing one of those fingers, and not dying, you\u2019ve become a vessel, with two options. One: we kill Jules inside you, and keep searching for the other fingers. Or\u2026\u201d, Lion said. \u201c\u2026or what?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cThis is what I suggest. We find the rest of Jules-which is like\u202617 or 18 fingers-let him fully manifest inside you, and then execute you.\u201d Lion proposed. \u201cEither die right now, or die later, is basically what I\u2019m asking.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026\u201d, Mugman stuttered. \u201c\u2026fine. I\u2019ll eat the rest of Jules and then I\u2019ll be executed.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cCool. Just know that in order to do this, you\u2019ll have to enroll into Jujutsu High. And, acquire some cursed energy, and technique, and Domain Expansion, and cursed tool, and-\u201c, Lion said, rambling on and on, before he saw Mugman just staring at him in confusion. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the school, first.\u201d, Lion said, recognizing Mugmans confusion. We then cut to Lion and Mugman walking into the school. \u201cWow, this place looks very old. I can\u2019t wait to make it look even uglier.\u201d, Jules said, who had recently learned how to speak throw making little mouths on Mugman. \u201cSorry, Lion. He does that sometimes.\u201d, Mugman said, covering the tiny mouth that Jules made. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cHey, Lion? I have a question.\u201d, Mugman said, as they were walking towards the doors. \u201cBetween you and Jules\u2026who would win?\u201d, Mugman asked. Lion thought for a moment, before answering. \u201cWell, if he were to get his full power back, he might cause me a little trouble.\u201d, Lion said. Mugman asked, \u201cbut would you lose?\u201d \u201cNah, I\u2019d win.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cTough talk coming from a brat.\u201d, Jules said through one of the little mouths he had made on Mugman. Lion stopped walking, and asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re wrong. When I reach my peak status, not only will you not be able to handle me, but after I kill you, I\u2019ll go after every single jujutsu sorcerer. Including this\u2026brat I\u2019m stuck inside currently.\u201d, Jules said. \u201cWow, to be killed by the greatest curse in history. I\u2019m touched.\u201d, Lion said, sarcastically. After they talked with the principal, Mugman was enrolled. \u201cWait, so, how many sorcerers are at this school?\u201d, Mugman said as Lion walked him to his room. \u201cLike\u2026eight students\u2026\u201d, Lion said nervously and awkwardly. \u201cOh.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cBut, some of your friends are here. Like, Alice, Bendy and Cuphead.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cWait, what?! And they didn\u2019t tell me?!\u201d, Mugman said, angry. \u201cSurprise.\u201d, Lion said, before he opened Mugman room. \u201cSo, question for you, Mugman. Will you come on the missions for retrieving Jules\u2019 fingers?\u201d, Lion said, handing Mugman his stuff. Mugman thought for a moment, before he answered. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll help. Although, it would be funny to see a beat up Cuphead bring me fingers.\u201d, Mugman said, before he chuckled. \u201cOh, really.\u201d, Cuphead said, towering behind Mugman. \u201cUh\u2026I didn\u2019t mean that\u2026Cuphead\u2026\u201d, Mugman said with an awkward grin. \u201cUh huh. Whatever. I\u2019m also coming, Mugman.\u201d, Cuphead said to Mugman. \u201cWhat about your club, though?\u201d, Mugman asked. Cuphead looked at Mugman in confusion, before answering. \u201cUh, Mugman? This IS the secret club.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cSo, Mugman. Since you\u2019re coming on missions, you\u2019ll probably need a weapon since you don\u2019t have a cursed technique. Or, any cursed energy. Or anything cursed right now. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving you this.\u201d, Lion said, before he pulled out a combat knife, and held it out to Mugman. It had a black fur guard and a brown handle. \u201cThis weapon is already imbued with cursed energy, so even you can use it.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cWoah\u2026what\u2019s it called?\u201d, Mugman said, with a sparkle in his eye, looking at the knife. \u201cUh, we don\u2019t have a name for it, but, it\u2019s yours, so you can name it.\u201d, Lion said, as Mugman took it. \u201cI\u2019ll name it\u2026Earth, Wind and Fire.\u201d, Mugman said. Cuphead snickered, before saying, \u201cWait, like, the band?\u201d \u201cYeah, like the band. It came to me.\u201d, Mugman said, slightly annoyed at Cupheads question. \u201cAlright. Get cleaned up, and set up your room. In two days\u2026\u201d, Lion said.<br/>\u201c\u2026we\u2019re heading to Tokyo.\u201d, Lion added.<br/>We then cut to two days later, with Lion, Cuphead and Mugman arriving in the main part of Tokyo, Japan. \u201cHey, Lion? Who are we waiting for?\u201d, Mugman asked, while he was holding a cup of beef ramen, and wearing cool sunglasses. \u201cOh, we\u2019re waiting for bendy.\u201d, Lion said, as he sipped some Japanese soda. \u201cBleh.\u201d, Lion said, tasting the soda. \u201cWell, how long \u2018this gonna take? My feet hurt.\u201d, Cuphead asked, as he was eating some potato chips. \u201cI\u2019d say one hour, five minutes, and seventeen seconds, starting\u2026now!\u201d, Lion said, as he took another sip from his soda. \u201cBleh.\u201d, he said, tasting it again. \u201cWhy do you keep on drinking it if it tastes bad, Lion?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cIt\u2019s to keep my cursed energy up.\u201d, Lion answered. \u201cHuh?\u201d, Mugman said confused. \u201cCan you explain?\u201d, Mugman asked Lion. \u201cAlright, so, cursed energy fuels our attacks, right? But, the thing about cursed energy is that we need negative emotions to help channel it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m drinking it. It tastes unpleasant, and it fuels my cursed energy.\u201d, Lion explains. \u201cWait, so, is Cuphead doing the same too?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m eating the worst flavor; Durian Fruit Flavored Potato Chips.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cEw.\u201d Mugman said. \u201cHey, guys! Am I late?\u201d, Bendy said, walking through the crowd of people. But, bendy can\u2019t get through. Then, he gets fed up, and he says, \u201cVERB: STOP.\u201d Then, suddenly, everyone stops in their tracks. Bendy moves through the crowd, and eventually makes it to his gang. \u201cVerb: Continue.\u201d, Bendy said, and then the crowd continues moving, not even noticing that they stopped. \u201cWOAH, BENDY?! WHAT WAS THAT?!\u201d, Mugman said in amazement. \u201cOh, it\u2019s my cursed technique: Jagged Edge. Basically, I can pick from verbs, noun, exclamations, and adjectives, and use them. For example\u2026Noun: Soda.\u201d, Bendy explained, before a can of soda appeared in his hand. \u201cSee?\u201d, Bendy asked. \u201cCursed\u2026technique?\u201d, Mugman asked confused. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re basically our powers that we use to exorcise curses. Bendys  Cursed Technique, Jagged Edge, allows him to use his language to\u2026uh\u2026do that.\u201d Lion explained. \u201cOh, alright. Then what\u2019s yours and Cupheads cursed techniques?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cMines called Survivor. It allows me to channel my cursed energy into certain parts of my body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage I do.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cAnd what about you, Cuphead?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cMine is called Beat It. It lets me move any surface around me, like manipulate it, along with turn any item, along with other items into an invention on the spot. I can also grab any tiny parts of a surface/machine, and shoot it at my opponent.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cCool! When do I get mine?!\u201d, Mugman asked, jumping up and down. \u201cNot soon.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cAlright gang, follow me.\u201d, Lion added, before walking off. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d, Mugman said, before dragging his feet and following Lion. Eventually, they reach an old building. \u201cAlright. Bendy and Mugman. This is your test to see how strong you are. Whoever can exorcise the curse first gets a treat, paid for by me.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cWait, what? What about the finger?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cWell, we need to see if you\u2019re capable. So, like I said.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cMe and Cuphead here will spectate. Head on inside, and get that curse.\u201d, Lion said, before sitting down. \u201cAlright. See if you can keep up, Mugman!\u201d, Bendy yelled, before in the blink of an eye, he dashed inside. \u201cWoah, how did he move so fast?! Bendy can barely run within six feet of him without passing out!\u201d, Mugman shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the additions that come with being a sorcerer. You also get your other physical feats leveled up the more cursed energy you have.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cMan\u2026\u201d, Mugman said, before quickly running inside. \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cMugman may die in there, Lion.\u201d Lion glanced at Cuphead, before turning back and saying, \u201cHe\u2019s strong. He\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d, Cuphead asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll help him.\u201d, Lion said. We then cut to Mugman walking through the empty hallways of the building. \u201cMan, this stinks. Figuratively and literally.\u201d, Mugman said, as he was playing with Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugman then accidentally cuts his hand on Earth, Wind and Fire. \u201cOuch!\u201d, Mugman said, as Earth, Wind, and Fire hit the ground. Then, suddenly, his wound heals, almost instantaneously. \u201cWoah.\u201d, Mugman said. Let me explain, real quick, to explain what happened. Mugman here just cut himself with a cursed tool. Cursed tools are imbued with cursed energy. Let\u2019s just use numbers for an example. Let\u2019s say that Earth, Wind and Fire has a cursed energy level of\u2026two million. Not a lot for a cursed tool, but I\u2019d say a little above average. When Mugman cut himself with Earth, Wind and Fire, he was imbued with\u2026let\u2019s say\u2026half of that. So, he now has cursed energy, one million, to be exact. And, when he was imbued with the energy, he got so much a human couldn\u2019t handle, that he reflexively performed Reverse Cursed Technique, which healed him. So, now Mugman can unlock his Cursed Technique, and become a sorcerer way earlier than he\u2019s supposed to. But, he doesn\u2019t know all this. Mugman stared at the wound, now healed. \u201cThat\u2019s freaky.\u201d, Mugman said to himself. Then,suddenly, he heard some groaning coming from another room. Mugman walked over to the room, to see a slug-like creature, or curse, staring at the clock. \u201cWHAT\u2026TIME IS IT?\u201d, it said in a distorted voice. \u201cIt\u2019s time\u2026to get your butt kicked.\u201d, Mugman muttered, before he pulled out Earth, Wind and Fire out of a knife holster on his leg. He dashed in the blink of an eye, behind the curse, and cut it in half, without even thinking. \u201cWHAT THE SIGMA\u2049\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\u201d, Mugman said, before he put back his weapon. \u201cHow did I-\u201c, Mugman thought, before he heard Bendy walking towards the room, hearing the commotion. \u201cHey, Mugman, I heard a slash-\u201c, Bendy said, before he saw the curse, cut in half. \u201c\u2026Say, Mugman\u2026how did you defeat that curse\u2026?\u201d, Bendy asked. \u201cI acted on instinct, I guess.\u201d, Mugman said. \u201cInstinct, huh?\u201d, Bendy said. As quick as lighting, Bendy pulled out a sword, and swung at Mugman. Mugman, not even think, blocked it with Earth, Wind and Fire. \u201cLet\u2019s see how well you fight without any cursed energy.\u201d, Bendy said, before he kicked Mugman into a desk behind him. Mugman avoided the desk and threw Earth, Wind and Fire at Bendy, before grabbing EWF (short for Earth, Wind and Fire), and slicing and dicing at Bendy several times at Bendy. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Close in.\u201d, Mugman thought, as EWF and Bendys sword clashed multiple times. \u201cVerb: Sharpen.\u201d, Bendy said, before Mugman saw Bendys sword sharpen. Mugman kicked Bendys into a chalkboard, and continued to close in on bendy. Bendys grabbed some chalk by the chalkboard, and imbued it with some of his cursed energy, before saying, \u201cVerb: Multiply. Verb: Sharpen.\u201d, Before throwing 10 pieces of sharpened chalk at Mugman. Mugman quickly evaded all of them, with the only injury he sustained being a cut on his arm. Bendy grabbed his sword, and dashed out of the classroom, and racing up some stairs. Mugman quickly followed. Mugman made it to the top of the stairs, before he saw a hallway of abandoned lockers. Mugman walked past these lockers, as he held onto EWF tightly. \u201cSUPRISE!\u201d, Bendy shouted, lunging from one of the lockers, and kicking Mugman in the face, sending him flying. Mugman lands in another abandoned classroom. Bendy flies in, and bites on his sword, before saying, \u201cAdjective: Duplicate. Time frame of twenty one seconds. Five exact copies. Starting now.\u201d Suddenly, four more Bendys appeared beside the original Bendy, and lunged at Mugman. Mugman quickly realized he had to get rid of the four other Bendys quickly, and thought. And he thought quick. Mugman thought, \u201cWhat do I do in this situation?\u201d Suddenly, Mugmans cursed energy had focused on one of the Bendys, and Mugman instinctively said. \u201cDismantle.\u201d Suddenly, the bendy clone that Mugmans energy focused on, was cut in half by one big slash caused by EWF. The other Bendys looked at the Ben-dy that was cut in half, and stopped in their tracks. They then looked at Mugman, who looked at another clone. \u201cCleave.\u201d, Mugman said, and multiple grid like slices hit one of the Bendys clones, dicing the clone into cubes. \u201cMugman, how did you get a cursed technique with no cursed energy?\u201d, Bendy asked, as he readied his sword.<br/>Mugman didn\u2019t respond, and he cut through the two other Bendy clones, before saying, \u201cDismantle.\u201d Again, sending a slice big enough to cut a person in two at bendy. Bendy blocked it with his sword, but Mugman used this chance to get behind bendy, and use Cleave to cut him all over his back. Bendy stabs his sword into the ground, and says, \u201cVERB: EXPLODE!\u201d, making the ground below Mugman and Bendy explode and fall, sending them falling into the abandoned schools cafeteria. Mugman jumps back and forth on the broken pieces of ground, dashing through the air to get to Bendy. Bendy starts backing up to get some distance, and he eventually makes it down to the ground. Bendy grabs onto a cafeteria table, and chucks it at Mugman. Mugman slices through it with a Dismantle slice, and then says, \u201cErase.\u201d, before slicing the space in front of him to pull himself towards Bendy. Bendy blocks Mugman slice, and dashes away, before saying, \u201cVerb: Ignite.\u201d Bendys sword then catches fire, before he dashes towards Mugman. Mugman dashes towards Bendy, and the two clash. Bendy quickly pulls away, and Mugman falls forward, and it looks like Bendys is gonna stab Mugman. But at the last second, Bendys says, \u201cVerb: Bind.\u201d, Catching Mugman before he gets impaled on Bendys blade. Mugman catches his breath, and he quickly passes out due to exhaustion. Mugman then wakes up in his schools infirmary.<br/>\u201cWakey Wakey, Eggs and Bakey.\u201d, Lion says. \u201cWhat\u2026Lion\u2026?\u201d, Mugman says groggily. Mugman tries to get up, but he winces in pain, as he falls back on the bed. \u201cEasy there, Mugman. You\u2019re pretty sore after your battle with Bendy. You did pretty good on the battlefield with no cursed energy.\u201d, Lion said, holding a bowl of something. \u201cUh-\u201c, Mugman tries to say something, but Lion shushes him. \u201cRest, Mugman. You need to eat.\u201d, Lion says, before he opens to bowl lid to reveal three of Jules fingers. \u201cBut, eat these first, then talk, and then keep eating.\u201d, Lion says. \u201cAlright. Wait, so, I mistook these for a pickle? Man.\u201d, Mugman comments, before taking one and swallowing it whole. Mugman then feels Jules curse inside him grow stronger. Mugman gags and laughs. \u201cEw! It\u2019s so gross it makes you laugh.\u201d, Mugman said, as he grabbed another. \u201cSo, how was Bendy?\u201d, Lion asked as Mugman ate another finger. \u201cStrong as hell! He moved so fast, and he could think real quick. But I\u2019m quicker. I don\u2019t know how I had lost.\u201d, Mugman said, as he finished the last finger in the bowl. Mugman gagged again, while clutching his throat. \u201cWell, Bendy is a second year, so he is more experienced with his technique.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cSo, Mugman. How in the world did you get cursed energy AND a cursed technique?\u201d, Lion asked seriously. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I think it has something to do with this cut.\u201d, Mugman said, before revealing his hand to Lion. \u201cI accidentally cut myself with EWF, and my hand was instantly healed\u2026somehow.\u201d, Mugman continued. \u201cAlright. Lemme see your technique though, I\u2019m interested.\u201d, lion said, before quickly dashing out of the room and bringing in a dummy. \u201cOkay, be careful, though.\u201d, Mugman said, holding out his hand. \u201cDismantle.\u201d, Mugman said, before the dummy was sliced in half. Mugman then followed up with, \u201cCleave\u201d, cutting the dummy into cubes. Then, Mugman got rid of the dummy by saying, \u201cErase.\u201d, and erasing the dummy. \u201cCool, Mugman. This is a pretty powerful technique.\u201d, Lion said.  \u201cThanks. I don\u2019t have a name for it, though. Like you guys.\u201d, Mugman said, lowering his hand. \u201cHow about\u2026Purple Rain?\u201d, Lion suggested while looking at some old music. \u201cHmm\u2026sure.\u201d, Mugman guessed, as he laid back down. \u201cGet some rest. We\u2019ll go on another mission for one of Jules fingers tomorrow if you\u2019re okay.\u201d, Lion said, before he left. Mugman nodded, and went to sleep. Mugman then woke up in some dream realm, staring face to face with Jules, the king of curses stuck inside his body. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is a dream. But I\u2019m real.\u201d, Jules said. \u201cWhat\u2026what do you want\u2026?\u201d, Mugman asked cautiously. \u201cI want to make a deal with you, Mugman. Here\u2019s the proposition: I give you some of my cursed energy, along with knowledge of cursed\u2026.anything that can help you in battle. This includes domain expansion, cursed techniques, cursed tools, binding vows, and heavenly restrictions. In return\u2026whenever I say the word, \u2018Enchant\u2019, I can take control of your body for up to five minutes tops. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d, Jules said. \u201cHell no! How do I know that-\u201c, Mugman yelled, before Jules cut him off by saying, \u201cwithin that time frame, I\u2019m not allowed to harm or injure anybody. Does that seal the deal?\u201d Mugman thought for a moment, before asking, \u201canything else I should be aware about?\u201d \u201cYou will forget that you made this deal with me.\u201d, Jules added. \u201cSo, our deal goes as follows: I get knowledge about domain expansion, cursed techniques, cursed tools, binding vows, and heavenly restrictions. and you get to take control of my body for five minutes whenever you say the word \u2018Enchant\u2019. I forget that we made this deal, and you can\u2019t harm or injure anybody while you possess me. Am I right?\u201d, Mugman recounted. \u201cYup.\u201d, Jules said casually. \u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d, Jules asked. Mugman thought about this. Mugman thought really hard. \u201cWhy do you want to take control of my body if you can\u2019t hurt anyone?\u201d, Mugman asked. Jules slightly panicked, before answering Mugman, saying, \u201cFine. I agree.\u201d Jules grins, his teeth showing. \u201cExcellent. See you soon, Mugman. Literally.\u201d, Jules said, shaking Mugman hand, before the dream ends. Mugman then wakes up in the infirmary. \u201cHey, Mugman. You alright?\u201d, Bendy says, standing on a wall. \u201cSorry that I attacked you yesterday. Lion wanted me to test you. See how good you were. I didn\u2019t expect you to have cursed energy, let alone, a cursed technique somehow. That\u2019s why I went all out on you after you beat my clones.\u201d, Bendy continues. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d, Mugman says. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the mission for today?\u201d, Mugman asks. \u201cWait, hold on. Aren\u2019t you still hurt or sore?\u201d, Bendy asks, \u201cI mean, you ARE in the infirmary for a reason that we both know.\u201d \u201cActually, I feel pretty good. Those fingers Lion gave me must have helped with healing or something.\u201d Mugman lied. With his new knowledge, he knew that it was Reversed Curse Technique that healed him so quickly, but he couldn\u2019t just blatantly say that. \u201cWell, if you say so. Anyway, we\u2019re heading to a place that might have one of Jules fingers. This time, you\u2019ll have to go in alone. If you are hurt, you gotta fall back or tag out.\u201d,  Bendy said, showing Mugman the location on a map. \u201cGot it. Lemme get changed real quick.\u201d, Mugman said, as he walked out of the infirmary to ask Lion for his clothes. \u201cHey, Lion? Can I have my clothes-\u201c, Mugman says, before a pen is thrown at Mugman. Mugman subconsciously activates Cleave, and gets rid of the pen. \u201cGood reflexes, Mugman.\u201d, Lion said, throwing ten more at him. Mugman Cleaves those too. Lion stands up, and says, \u201cGood reflexes, Mugman. Hopefully you\u2019ll use them in your solo mission.\u201d, Lion says. \u201cYeah. Anywho, can I have my clothes?\u201d, Mugman asks. Lion pulls out a laundry basket, and finds a student uniform labeled, \u201cMugman\u201d, and hands it to Mugman. \u201cHere is your new uniform, Mug. Uh, try not to ruin this, please? Students uniforms are expensive, and this one was made especially for you.\u201d, Lion said nervously. Mugman checks the price tag to see that it cost seventeen thousand dollars for this one uniform.<br/>\u201cSeventeen thousand?!\u201d Mugman gasps, his eyes nearly popping out of his head. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s more than most cars!\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t want you to ruin it, so\u2026please don\u2019t?\u201d, Lion asks again. Mugman gulps in nervousness. \u201cUhh, I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d Mugman walks out of Lions office. Then, he remembers a question he had for Lion. Well, it was two, but still. His first question was where was the mission gonna be, and his second question was to ask about what a Domain Expansion was, since he wasn\u2019t really sure if he can trust the information in his head. \u201cUh, hey, Lion? I have a question. Well, it\u2019s two. But, whatever.\u201d, Mugman said, walking back into Lions office. \u201cAlright, spit.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cUh, where\u2019s my mission gonna be today?\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just an abounded mall just outside of Tokyo.\u201d, Lion said, writing something down on a paper. \u201cOkay. Oh, and\u2026can you tell me what a Domain Expansion is? I heard you tell me it when you kidnapped me and tied me to a chair and discussed my options, but you never said anything beyond the name.\u201d, Mugman asked. \u201cHmm\u2026how do I explain this\u2026The simplest way I can put it is like, having your own little word made up of your Cursed Energy. It\u2019s a place made for you to use your technique. It also has a Sure Hit Effect. But, this requires a lot of cursed energy and focus.\u201d, Lion explained. \u201cMost beginners can\u2019t use it once they begin, but they learn how to do it later on.\u201d, Lion added. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d, Mugman said. We then cut to the abandoned shop. \u201cAlright Mugman. Remember, if you\u2019re in trouble, fall out and call for help.\u201d, Lion said. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re right outside.\u201d, Bendy said. \u201cYup.\u201d, Cuphead said. \u201cWow, Cuphead, thanks for your shining enthusiasm.\u201d, Mugman said sarcastically, before walking inside the shop. Mugman began to walk through the first floor of the mall, looking for the finger. \u201cMan, this is creepy. And not like the creepy you see in cartoons.\u201d, Mugman said. He kept on walking through the hallways, until he say the finger, sitting alone in a closed water fountain. However, the water was still running somehow. And it looked fresh. And the finger was inside it, just sitting there. \u201cA trap, huh?\u201d, Mugman said. He then smirked, and played dumb. \u201cOh, no! I sure do hope that there aren\u2019t any cursed spirits around! After all, I\u2019m only a grade FOUR sorcerer, oh, imagine the agony!\u201d, Mugman said as he walked over to the fountain. Mugman reached the fountain, and reached for the finger reeeeaaaalllyyy slllooowwwllleeeyyy\u2026.\u201dhere I go, reaching for the special grade cursed object!\u201d, Mugman said. Then, suddenly, a sharp water spike shot out of the ground, almost impaling Mugman hand. Mugman pulled back, and whipped out EWF. \u201cKnew it.\u201d, Mugman said, before the water based cursed spirit formed on the finger. \u201cAlright, I just woke up, so would you be so kind as to hand over the finger now?\u201d, Mugman said, holding out his hand. The sprit screeched at Mugman. Mugman grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hoped you\u2019d say.\u201d, Mugman said, signaling the curse to come at him. The curse sent out spiky water tendrils. But Mugman quickly zoomed through the air, cutting through them. Mugman made his way towards the cursed spirit, and tried to kick it, but went straight through it. Mugman crashed into a closed shop in the mall. \u201cRight. It\u2019s water.\u201d, He said, before getting up and dusting himself off. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s try this again, yeah?\u201d, Mugman said, getting into a battle stance. The cursed sprit lunged at him. \u201cErase.\u201d, Mugman said, pointing EWF at the cursed spirit. The cursed spirit was washed away, but it\u2019ll be back in a matter of seconds. Mugman thought about how he could defeat a cursed spirit like this. He couldn\u2019t use physical attacks. So, what now? Maybe he could\u2026no, that\u2019s too risky. Besides, he hasn\u2019t even attempted it before. But, he knew he needed to get the finger, and impress his peers. Mugman gulped with nervousness, but put on a smile. \u201cYou know what?! Forget it!\u201d, Mugman said, dropping EWF. The cursed spirit regenerated, and saw Mugman charging up his energy, but for what. Mugman then put his hands out, and called out, \u201cDomain Expansion\u2026\u201d<br/>The cursed sprit looked in awe as the 2 meters surrounding them were enclosed in a black dome. Mugman closed his eyes, and continued his chant.<br/>\u201c\u2026Rigid Coffin of The Devil Himself.\u201d<br/>Suddenly, the dome took form of a torture chamber, with knives, swords, stuck in the walls, and lava on the ground surrounding them both\uff0e\u201dLook at that! It worked! However, it\u2019s incomplete. I bet it\u2019s ugly for most sorcerers. But it\u2019ll have to do for now.\u201d, Mugman said, seemingly talking to the cursed spirit. The cursed spirit panicked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, spirit? You scared of a nine year old not knowing what he\u2019s doing?\u201d, Mugman said, mocking the spirit. \u201cYou\u2019d better be. Dismantle.\u201d, Mugman said, before a wave of lava cut the spirit in half, exorcising it. Mugman lowered his domain, and fell to one knee. \u201cDamn, that took a lot out of me. But\u2026I got the finger! And that\u2019s all I need.\u201d, Mugman said to himself, sweat pouring down his forehead. Suddenly, Mugman got a text from his phone.</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>He checked his phone and saw a message from Lion, \"Mission complete? Need aid?\"</p>\n<p>Mugman clumsily typed back with fingers that trembled from exertion, \"Got it. Coming out.\"</p>\n<p>Panting, Mugman rose to his feet and approached the fountain. He reached into the water, pulling out the now inert cursed finger, still wet from its eerie perch. He stuffed it into his pocket and headed toward the entrance of the abandoned mall.</p>\n<p>As he emerged into the daylight, the rest of the group awaited him. Lion looked at Mugman with a mix of concern and pride, Bendy clapped his hands enthusiastically, and even Cuphead couldn't hide a pleased grin.</p>\n<p>\"Wow, Mugman! You look like you've been run over by a tractor. But you got it, huh?\" Cuphead chuckled, poking fun in his typical brotherly fashion.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I did. It wasn't easy, though,\" Mugman said, managing a tired smile.</p>\n<p>Lion approached him and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"You did well. A solo mission on your first day as a sorcerer, and you executed a Domain Expansion\u2014albeit incomplete, it's still impressive.\"</p>\n<p>Bendy whistled, \"An incomplete Domain Expansion on your first day? Man, what kind of monster are you?\"</p>\n<p>Mugman shrugged, exhaustion seeping into his every bone. \"Guess I'm just lucky.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, let's get you back to Jujutsu High. You need rest, and we need to report this. With that finger, we're one step closer to containing Jules completely,\" Lion said, ushering him back towards the car.</p>\n<p>As they drove back, Mugman couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and dread. He knew that with each finger he consumed, the presence of Jules grew stronger within him. He couldn't help but wonder, what did Jules really want with his body, and what was the true extent of the cursed king's power? </p>\n<p>But for now, he pushed these thoughts aside. He had friends and teachers who had his back, and more immediately, he had a bed at Jujutsu High with his name on it for a well-deserved rest.</p></div>"}, "205c102b28e9594245c03c8be628725f9be16bbaa5582600db1888e4b8a2345e45853becc4dcf648f5e4a71ec37c8a12": {"id": "205c102b28e9594245c03c8be628725f9be16bbaa5582600db1888e4b8a2345e45853becc4dcf648f5e4a71ec37c8a12", "text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

A bacterial clearance assay was conducted to further investigate the effect of CiCXCL12a-mediated phagocytosis. The results showed that the numbers of A. hydrophila are significantly decreased after the addition of CiCXCL12a, and the numbers of A. hydrophila are markedly increased after Cyto D blockage (Figure 6A). Microbial cargo undergoes degradation through progressive fusions of the phagosome with early endosomes, late endosomes, and ultimately with lysosomes (Egami et al., 2011; Verma and Datta, 2017). The small GTPases, Rab5 and Rab7, are the key regulators of the transport of newly endocytosed vesicles to early and late endosomes (Jordens et al., 2005). To explore the potential involvement of CiCXCL12a in the expression of early endosomes markers (Rab5) and late endosomes markers (Rab7) proteins, we initially analyzed the protein expressions of Rab5 and Rab7. Our findings revealed that Rab5 and Rab7 are upregulated in monocytes/macrophages challenged with CiCXCL12a (Figure 6B, B\u2019). Subsequent analysis of Rab5 and Rab7 expression patterns following bacterial challenge demonstrated that two small GTPases (Rab5 and Rab7) increase significantly when compared with that of the control and CiCXCL12a treatment alone (Figure 6C, C\u2019). Furthermore, CiCXCL12a and A. hydrophila synergistically increase the expressions of Rab5 and Rab7 (Figure 6C, C\u2019). These results suggested that Rab5 and Rab7 play crucial roles in resistance against bacterial pathogens and Rab5 and Rab7 are participated in CiCXCL12a-mediated phagocytosis of monocyte/macrophage. We further detected that Rab5 and Rab7 are colocalized with A.hydrophila in grass carp monocytes/macrophages in a time dependent manner (Figure 6D and E). Also, FITC-labeled A.hydrophila was found to be colocalized with lysosomes of monocyte/macrophage stained with LysoBrite Red (Figure 6F). To confirm the involvement of lysosomes in A. hydrophila degradation, the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CLQ) was utilized to inhibit lysosomal activity (Chen et al., 2021), and the elimination of A. hydrophila was assessed. Although, the numbers of surviving A. hydrophila are obviously decreased after addition of CiCXCL12a, monocytes/macrophages appear to have lost their A. hydrophila degradation role after pretreating CLQ (Figure 6G). Taken together, the results suggested that Rab5 and Rab7 are involved in CiCXCL12a-mediated phagocytosis and lysosomes are involved in the elimination of A. hydropila.<br/>CiCXCL12 suppresses cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K-AKT signal pathway<br/>Apart from its conserved antibacterial activity and phagocytosis, CiCXCL12a treatments increase the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, STAT5 and ERK in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7A-D). However, the degradation of phosphorylation indued by CiCXCL12 are rapid within 30 min (Figure 7E and F). These results are consistent with human CXCL12 (HsCXCL12), which induces the activations of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT5 and MAPK-ERK signaling pathways (Delgado-Mart\u00edn et al., 2011; Mowafi et al., 2008). Previous study showed that HsCXCL12 suppresses cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway (Fu et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2010). To validate whether CiCXCL12a also inhibits cell apoptosis. We successfully constructed an LPS-induced apoptosis model in monocytes/macrophages and the precent of monocyte/macrophage apoptosis is suppressed after the addition of CiCXCL12a (Figure 7G), suggesting CiCXCL12a, similar to HsCXCL12, also has a conserved ability to attenuate cell apoptosis. Then, we used specific phosphorylation inhibitors for PI3K, AKT, STAT5 and ERK to inhibit the activation of these pathways (Figure 7H). Monocytes/macrophages were respectively pretreated with four specific phosphorylation inhibitors for 3 h, then incubation with 0.2 \u03bcM CiCXCL12a for 3 h, and finally LPS was added each well for 16 h. STAT5 and ERK specific phosphorylation inhibitors have no effect for CiCXCL12a-suppressed monocyte/macrophage apoptosis induced by LPS (Figure 7I, I\u2019). However, significant inhibition of monocyte/macrophage apoptosis induced by CiCXCL12a is alleviated after pretreating with both PI3K and AKT specific phosphorylation inhibitors (Figure 7I, I\u2019). These results indicated that CXCL12 has a conserved role in inhibiting cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway. \u5e2e\u6211\u6da6\u8272\u82f1\u6587\u8bed\u6cd5<br/></div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>After phagocytosis or internalization, pathogens are transferred to phagosomes, which subsequently fuse with intracellular granules to form phagolysosomes.

However, the degradation of phosphorylation induced by CiCXCL12 is rapid within 30 minutes (Figure 7E and F). These results are consistent with human CXCL12 (HsCXCL12), which induces the activations of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT5, and MAPK-ERK signaling pathways (Delgado-Mart\u00edn et al., 2011; Mowafi et al., 2008). A previous study showed that HsCXCL12 suppresses cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway (Fu et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2010). To validate whether CiCXCL12a also inhibits cell apoptosis, we successfully constructed an LPS-induced apoptosis model in monocytes/macrophages, and the percentage of monocyte/macrophage apoptosis is suppressed after the addition of CiCXCL12a (Figure 7G), suggesting that CiCXCL12a, similar to HsCXCL12, also has a conserved ability to attenuate cell apoptosis. Then, we used specific phosphorylation inhibitors for PI3K, AKT, STAT5, and ERK to inhibit the activation of these pathways (Figure 7H). Monocytes/macrophages were respectively pretreated with four specific phosphorylation inhibitors for 3 hours, then incubated with 0.2 \u03bcM CiCXCL12a for 3 hours, and finally, LPS was added to each well for 16 hours. STAT5 and ERK specific phosphorylation inhibitors have no effect on CiCXCL12a-suppressed monocyte/macrophage apoptosis induced by LPS (Figure 7I, I\u2019). However, significant inhibition of monocyte/macrophage apoptosis induced by CiCXCL12a is alleviated after pretreating with both PI3K and AKT specific phosphorylation inhibitors (Figure 7I, I\u2019). These results indicate that CXCL12 has a conserved role in inhibiting cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM.

A bacterial clearance assay was conducted to further investigate the effect of CiCXCL12a-mediated phagocytosis. The results showed that the numbers of A. hydrophila are significantly decreased after the addition of CiCXCL12a, and the numbers of A. hydrophila are markedly increased after Cyto D blockage (Figure 6A). Microbial cargo undergoes degradation through progressive fusions of the phagosome with early endosomes, late endosomes, and ultimately with lysosomes (Egami et al., 2011; Verma and Datta, 2017). The small GTPases, Rab5 and Rab7, are the key regulators of the transport of newly endocytosed vesicles to early and late endosomes (Jordens et al., 2005). To explore the potential involvement of CiCXCL12a in the expression of early endosomes markers (Rab5) and late endosomes markers (Rab7) proteins, we initially analyzed the protein expressions of Rab5 and Rab7. Our findings revealed that Rab5 and Rab7 are upregulated in monocytes/macrophages challenged with CiCXCL12a (Figure 6B, B\u2019). Subsequent analysis of Rab5 and Rab7 expression patterns following bacterial challenge demonstrated that two small GTPases (Rab5 and Rab7) increase significantly when compared with that of the control and CiCXCL12a treatment alone (Figure 6C, C\u2019). Furthermore, CiCXCL12a and A. hydrophila synergistically increase the expressions of Rab5 and Rab7 (Figure 6C, C\u2019). These results suggested that Rab5 and Rab7 play crucial roles in resistance against bacterial pathogens and Rab5 and Rab7 are participated in CiCXCL12a-mediated phagocytosis of monocyte/macrophage. We further detected that Rab5 and Rab7 are colocalized with A.hydrophila in grass carp monocytes/macrophages in a time dependent manner (Figure 6D and E). Also, FITC-labeled A.hydrophila was found to be colocalized with lysosomes of monocyte/macrophage stained with LysoBrite Red (Figure 6F). To confirm the involvement of lysosomes in A. hydrophila degradation, the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CLQ) was utilized to inhibit lysosomal activity (Chen et al., 2021), and the elimination of A. hydrophila was assessed. Although, the numbers of surviving A. hydrophila are obviously decreased after addition of CiCXCL12a, monocytes/macrophages appear to have lost their A. hydrophila degradation role after pretreating CLQ (Figure 6G).

He had been abducted by an evil drone from an intergalactic empire when he was only three years old. The drone had genetically transformed him into an adult and had given him a new identity and name.</p>\n<p>Despite his evil intentions, Gelsadra longed to see his mother again. He wanted to make amends for the things he had done and to finally reveal his true identity to her. And one day, his wish was granted.</p>\n<p>Gelsadra found himself facing his mother for the first time after many years apart. As he stood in front of her, he felt a mix of emotions. He was happy to be reunited with his mother but also nervous about how she would react to his actions.</p>\n<p>\"Mother, it's me. Sammi,\" he said, his voice quivering slightly.</p>\n<p>His mother gasped as she realized who he was. \"Sammi, my poor boy. What have they done to you?\" she said, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>\n<p>Gelsadra knew it would take time for his mother to understand his predicament. He spent hours explaining his situation to her, detailing his journey from being a small boy to becoming an adult manipulated by the forces of evil.</p>\n<p>As the sun began to set, Gelsadra started to feel the urge to use the bathroom. He crossed his legs and tried to hide the discomfort on his face, not wanting to show any signs of weakness in front of his mother.</p>\n<p>But his mother noticed his discomfort and asked, \"Are you okay, Gelsadra?\"</p>\n<p>Gelsadra didn't want to admit that he needed to go to the bathroom, so he just nodded and remained silent.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, Gelsadra. You can tell me,\" his mother said, sensing that something was not right.</p>\n<p>Gelsadra hesitated for a moment before finally blurting out, \"I need to pee!\"</p>\n<p>His mother burst out laughing, and Gelsadra felt a sense of relief. He had been so caught up in his villainous persona that he had forgotten how to be himself.</p>\n<p>After that awkward moment, Gelsadra and his mother continued to talk late into the night. They laughed, cried, and hugged each other tightly, finally able to reconnect after such a long time apart.</p>\n<p>From that day on, Gelsadra fought alongside the main hero team, using his unique abilities for good. He kept his villainous persona as a way of instilling fear in his enemies, but he also knew that he could be himself around his mother and the main hero team.</p>\n<p>Every time he saw his mother, Gelsadra felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he had found his true home, and he would never let himself be taken away again.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "Simulate a person using an LLM. Respond like a regular person.

After a long talk they finally make up. But at one point he starts needing to pee very badly. Even though he is redeemed he still wants to keep up his intimidating fearsome persona and doesn\u2019t want to embarrass himself in front of her. The villain is very androgynous and is more on the gender neutral side but for the sake of this story just refer to them as he/him. Make it kinda funny and heartwarming too. The name of the villain is Gelsadra. But that is only the name the evil drone gave him. His real name is Sammi and that is how his mother starts calling him after finding out who he is. But I want you to stil refer to him as Gelsadra when his mother is not talking. Make sure you add a lot of dialogue too</div><br/><br/>LLM response:<br/><div style=\"\n    background-color: #fff3e6;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    line-height: 1.6;\"><p>Gelsadra, the fearsome villain, stood tall and proud as he stared down at the main hero team. He was their sworn enemy and had done everything in his power to thwart their every move. But deep down, Gelsadra had a secret. He was not really the evil villain he appeared to be.</p>\n<p>In reality, Gelsadra was once a small boy named Sammi. He had been abducted by an evil drone from an intergalactic empire when he was only three years old. The drone had genetically transformed him into an adult and had given him a new identity and name.</p>\n<p>Despite his evil intentions, Gelsadra longed to see his mother again. He wanted to make amends for the things he had done and to finally reveal his true identity to her. And one day, his wish was granted.</p>\n<p>Gelsadra found himself facing his mother for the first time after many years apart. As he stood in front of her, he felt a mix of emotions. He was happy to be reunited with his mother but also nervous about how she would react to his actions.</p>\n<p>\"Mother, it's me. Sammi,\" he said, his voice quivering slightly.</p>\n<p>His mother gasped as she realized who he was. \"Sammi, my poor boy. What have they done to you?\" she said, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>\n<p>Gelsadra knew it would take time for his mother to understand his predicament. He spent hours explaining his situation to her, detailing his journey from being a small boy to becoming an adult manipulated by the forces of evil.</p>\n<p>As the sun began to set, Gelsadra started to feel the urge to use the bathroom. He crossed his legs and tried to hide the discomfort on his face, not wanting to show any signs of weakness in front of his mother.</p>\n<p>But his mother noticed his discomfort and asked, \"Are you okay, Gelsadra?\"</p>\n<p>Gelsadra didn't want to admit that he needed to go to the bathroom, so he just nodded and remained silent.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, Gelsadra. You can tell me,\" his mother said, sensing that something was not right.</p>\n<p>Gelsadra hesitated for a moment before finally blurting out, \"I need to pee!\"</p>\n<p>His mother burst out laughing, and Gelsadra felt a sense of relief. He had been so caught up in his villainous persona that he had forgotten how to be himself.</p>\n<p>After that awkward moment, Gelsadra and his mother continued to talk late into the night. They laughed, cried, and hugged each other tightly, finally able to reconnect after such a long time apart.</p>\n<p>From that day on, Gelsadra fought alongside the main hero team, using his unique abilities for good. He kept his villainous persona as a way of instilling fear in his enemies, but he also knew that he could be himself around his mother and the main hero team.</p>\n<p>Every time he saw his mother, Gelsadra felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he had found his true home, and he would never let himself be taken away again.</p></div>"}}
